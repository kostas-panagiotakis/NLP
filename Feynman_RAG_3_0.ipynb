Of course an ordinary object does not simply rotate, it wobbles, shakes, and bends, so to simplify matters we shall discuss the motion of a nonexistent ideal object which we call a rigid body. This means an object in which the forces between the atoms are so strong, and of such character, that the little forces that are needed to move it do not bend it. Its shape stays essentially the same as it moves about. If we wish to study the motion of such a body, and agree to ignore the motion of its center of mass, there is only one thing left for it to do, and that is to turn. We have to describe that. How? Suppose there is some line in the body which stays put (perhaps it includes the center of mass and perhaps not), and the body is rotating about this particular line as an axis. How do we define the rotation? That is easy enough, for if we mark a point somewhere on the object, anywhere except on the axis, we can always tell exactly where the object is, if we only know where this point has gone to. The only thing needed to describe the position of that point is an angle. So rotation consists of a study of the variations of the angle with time. In order to study rotation, we observe the angle through which a body has turned. Of course, we are not referring to any particular angle inside the object itself; it is not that we draw some angle on the object. We are talking about the angular change of the position of the whole thing, from one time to another. First, let us study the kinematics of rotations. The angle will change with time, and just as we talked about position and velocity in one dimension, we may talk about angular position and angular velocity in plane rotation. In fact, there is a very interesting relationship between rotation in two dimensions and one-dimensional displacement, in which almost every quantity has its analog. First, we have the angle $\\\\theta$ which defines how far the body has gone around; this replaces the distance $s$, which defines how far it has gone along. In the same manner, we have a velocity of turning, $\\\\omega= d\\\\theta/dt$, which tells us how much the angle changes in a second, just as $v = ds/dt$ describes how fast a thing moves, or how far it moves in a second. If the angle is measured in radians, then the angular velocity $\\\\omega$ will be so and so many radians per second. The greater the angular velocity, the faster the object is turning, the faster the angle changes. We can go on: we can differentiate the angular velocity with respect to time, and we can call $\\\\alpha =$ $d\\\\omega/dt =$ $d^2\\\\theta/dt^2$ the angular acceleration. That would be the analog of the ordinary acceleration.  Now of course we shall have to relate the dynamics of rotation to the laws of dynamics of the particles of which the object is made, so we must find out how a particular particle moves when the angular velocity is such and such. To do this, let us take a certain particle which is located at a distance $r$ from the axis and say it is in a certain location $P(x, y)$ at a given instant, in the usual manner (Fig. 18\\u20131). If at a moment $\\\\Delta t$ later the angle of the whole object has turned through $\\\\Delta\\\\theta$, then this particle is carried with it. It is at the same radius away from $O$ as it was before, but is carried to $Q$. The first thing we would like to know is how much the distance $x$ changes and how much the distance $y$ changes. If $OP$ is called $r$, then the length $PQ$ is $r\\\\,\\\\Delta\\\\theta$, because of the way angles are defined. The change in $x$, then, is simply the projection of $r\\\\,\\\\Delta\\\\theta$ in the $x$-direction: \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:18:6} \\\\Delta x=-PQ\\\\sin\\\\theta=-r\\\\,\\\\Delta\\\\theta\\\\cdot(y/r)=-y\\\\,\\\\Delta\\\\theta. \\\\end{equation} Similarly, \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:18:7} \\\\Delta y=+x\\\\,\\\\Delta\\\\theta. \\\\end{equation} If the object is turning with a given angular velocity $\\\\omega$, we find, by dividing both sides of (18.6) and (18.7) by $\\\\Delta t$, that the velocity of the particle is \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:18:8} v_x=-\\\\omega y\\\\quad \\\\text{and}\\\\quad v_y=+\\\\omega x. \\\\end{equation} Of course if we want to find the magnitude of the velocity, we just write  \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:18:9} v=\\\\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^2y^2+\\\\omega^2x^2}= \\\\omega\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\\\omega r. \\\\end{equation} \\n \\\\begin{equation} \\\\begin{aligned} v=\\\\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}&=\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^2y^2+\\\\omega^2x^2}\\\\\\\\[1ex] &=\\\\omega\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\\\omega r. \\\\end{aligned} \\\\label{Eq:I:18:9} \\\\end{equation}  It should not be mysterious that the value of the magnitude of this velocity is $\\\\omega r$; in fact, it should be self-evident, because the distance that it moves is $r\\\\,\\\\Delta\\\\theta$ and the distance it moves per second is $r\\\\,\\\\Delta\\\\theta/\\\\Delta t$, or $r\\\\omega$. Let us now move on to consider the dynamics of rotation. Here a new concept, force, must be introduced. Let us inquire whether we can invent something which we shall call the torque (L. torquere, to twist) which bears the same relationship to rotation as force does to linear movement. A force is the thing that is needed to make linear motion, and the thing that makes something rotate is a \\u201crotary force\\u201d or a \\u201ctwisting force,\\u201d i.e., a torque. Qualitatively, a torque is a \\u201ctwist\\u201d; what is a torque quantitatively? We shall get to the theory of torques quantitatively by studying the work done in turning an object, for one very nice way of defining a force is to say how much work it does when it acts through a given displacement. We are going to try to maintain the analogy between linear and angular quantities by equating the work that we do when we turn something a little bit when there are forces acting on it, to the torque times the angle it turns through. In other words, the definition of the torque is going to be so arranged that the theorem of work has an absolute analog: force times distance is work, and torque times angle is going to be work. That tells us what torque is. Consider, for instance, a rigid body of some kind with various forces acting on it, and an axis about which the body rotates. Let us at first concentrate on one force and suppose that this force is applied at a certain point $(x, y)$. How much work would be done if we were to turn the object through a very small angle? That is easy.  The work done is \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:18:10} \\\\Delta W=F_x\\\\,\\\\Delta x+F_y\\\\,\\\\Delta y. \\\\end{equation} We need only to substitute Eqs. (18.6) and (18.7) for $\\\\Delta x$ and $\\\\Delta y$ to obtain \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:18:11} \\\\Delta W=(xF_y-yF_x)\\\\Delta\\\\theta. \\\\end{equation} That is, the amount of work that we have done is, in fact, equal to the angle through which we have turned the object, multiplied by a strange-looking combination of the force and the distance. This \\u201cstrange combination\\u201d is what we call the torque. So, defining the change in work as the torque times the angle, we now have the formula for torque in terms of the forces. (Obviously, torque is not a completely new idea independent of Newtonian mechanics\\u2014torque must have a definite definition in terms of the force.) When there are several forces acting, the work that is done is, of course, the sum of the works done by all the forces, so that $\\\\Delta W$ will be a whole lot of terms, all added together, for all the forces, each of which is proportional, however, to $\\\\Delta\\\\theta$. We can take the $\\\\Delta\\\\theta$ outside and therefore can say that the change in the work is equal to the sum of all the torques due to all the different forces that are acting, times $\\\\Delta\\\\theta$. This sum we might call the total torque, $\\\\tau$. Thus torques add by the ordinary laws of algebra, but we shall later see that this is only because we are working in a plane. It is like one-dimensional kinematics, where the forces simply add algebraically, but only because they are all in the same direction. It is more complicated in three dimensions. Thus, for two-dimensional rotation, \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:18:12} \\\\tau_i=x_iF_{yi}-y_iF_{xi} \\\\end{equation} and \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:18:13} \\\\tau=\\\\sum\\\\tau_i. \\\\end{equation} It must be emphasized that the torque is about a given axis. If a different axis is chosen, so that all the $x_i$ and $y_i$ are changed, the value of the torque is (usually) changed too. Now we pause briefly to note that our foregoing introduction of torque, through the idea of work, gives us a most important result for an object in equilibrium: if all the forces on an object are in balance both for translation and rotation, not only is the net force zero, but the total of all the torques is also zero, because if an object is in equilibrium, no work is done by the forces for a small displacement. Therefore, since $\\\\Delta W = \\\\tau\\\\,\\\\Delta\\\\theta=0$, the sum of all the torques must be zero. So there are two conditions for equilibrium: that the sum of the forces is zero, and that the sum of the torques is zero. Prove that it suffices to be sure that the sum of torques about any one axis (in two dimensions) is zero. Now let us consider a single force, and try to figure out, geometrically, what this strange thing $xF_y - yF_x$ amounts to. In Fig. 18\\u20132 we see a force $\\\\FLPF$ acting at a point $\\\\FLPr$. When the object has rotated through a small angle $\\\\Delta\\\\theta$, the work done, of course, is the component of force in the direction of the displacement times the displacement. In other words, it is only the tangential component of the force that counts, and this must be multiplied by the distance $r\\\\,\\\\Delta\\\\theta$. Therefore we see that the torque is also equal to the tangential component of force (perpendicular to the radius) times the radius. That makes sense in terms of our ordinary idea of the torque, because if the force were completely radial, it would not put any \\u201ctwist\\u201d on the body; it is evident that the twisting effect should involve only the part of the force which is not pulling out from the center, and that means the tangential component. Furthermore, it is clear that a given force is more effective on a long arm than near the axis. In fact, if we take the case where we push right on the axis, we are not twisting at all!  So it makes sense that the amount of twist, or torque, is proportional both to the radial distance and to the tangential component of the force. There is still a third formula for the torque which is very interesting. We have just seen that the torque is the force times the radius times the sine of the angle $\\\\alpha$, in Fig. 18\\u20132. But if we extend the line of action of the force and draw the line $OS$, the perpendicular distance to the line of action of the force (the lever arm of the force) we notice that this lever arm is shorter than $r$ in just the same proportion as the tangential part of the force is less than the total force. Therefore the formula for the torque can also be written as the magnitude of the force times the length of the lever arm. The torque is also often called the moment of the force. The origin of this term is obscure, but it may be related to the fact that \\u201cmoment\\u201d is derived from the Latin movimentum, and that the capability of a force to move an object (using the force on a lever or crowbar) increases with the length of the lever arm. In mathematics \\u201cmoment\\u201d means weighted by how far away it is from an axis.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Let us see whether we can arrive at an approximation to an ellipse for the orbit. We shall suppose that the sun is infinitely heavy, in the sense that we shall not include its motion. Suppose a planet starts at a certain place and is moving with a certain velocity; it goes around the sun in some curve, and we shall try to analyze, by Newton’s laws of motion and his law of gravitation, what the curve is. How? At a given moment it is at some position in space. If the radial distance from the sun to this position is called $r$, then we know that there is a force directed inward which, according to the law of gravity, is equal to a constant times the product of the sun’s mass and the planet’s mass divided by the square of the distance. To analyze this further we must find out what acceleration will be produced by this force. We shall need the components of the acceleration along two directions, which we call $x$ and $y$. Thus if we specify the position of the planet at a given moment by giving $x$ and $y$ (we shall suppose that $z$ is always zero because there is no force in the $z$-direction and, if there is no initial velocity $v_z$, there will be nothing to make $z$ other than zero), the force is directed along the line joining the planet to the sun, as shown in Fig. 9–5. From this figure we see that the horizontal component of the force is related to the complete force in the same manner as the horizontal distance $x$ is to the complete hypotenuse $r$, because the two triangles are similar. Also, if $x$ is positive, $F_x$ is negative. That is, $F_x/\\\\abs{F}=-x/r$, or $F_x=$ $-\\\\abs{F}x/r=$ $-GMmx/r^3$. Now we use the dynamical law to find that this force component is equal to the mass of the planet times the rate of change of its velocity in the $x$-direction. Thus we find the following laws: \\\\begin{equation} \\\\begin{aligned} m(dv_x/dt)&=-GMmx/r^3,\\\\\\\\ m(dv_y/dt)&=-GMmy/r^3,\\\\\\\\ r&=\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}. \\\\end{aligned} \\\\label{Eq:I:9:17} \\\\end{equation} This, then, is the set of equations we must solve. Again, in order to simplify the numerical work, we shall suppose that the unit of time, or the mass of the sun, has been so adjusted (or luck is with us) that $GM\\\\equiv1$. For our specific example we shall suppose that the initial position of the planet is at $x=0.500$ and $y=0.000$, and that the velocity is all in the $y$-direction at the start, and is of magnitude $1.630$. Now how do we make the calculation? We again make a table with columns for the time, the $x$-position, the $x$-velocity $v_x$, and the $x$-acceleration $a_x$; then, separated by a double line, three columns for position, velocity, and acceleration in the $y$-direction. In order to get the accelerations we are going to need Eq. (9.17); it tells us that the acceleration in the $x$-direction is $-x/r^3$, and the acceleration in the $y$-direction is $-y/r^3$, and that $r$ is the square root of $x^2+y^2$. Thus, given $x$ and $y$, we must do a little calculating on the side, taking the square root of the sum of the squares to find $r$ and then, to get ready to calculate the two accelerations, it is useful also to evaluate $1/r^3$. This work can be done rather easily by using a table of squares, cubes, and reciprocals: then we need only multiply $x$ by $1/r^3$, which we do on a slide rule. Our calculation thus proceeds by the following steps, using time intervals $\\\\epsilon=0.100$: Initial values at $t=0$: \\\\begin{alignat*}{2} x(0)&=0.500&\\\\qquad\\\\qquad y(0)&=\\\\phantom{+}0.000\\\\\\\\[.5ex] v_x(0)&=0.000&\\\\qquad\\\\qquad v_y(0)&=+1.630 \\\\end{alignat*} From these we find: \\\\begin{alignat*}{2} r(0)&=\\\\phantom{-}0.500&\\\\qquad 1/r^3(0)&=8.000\\\\\\\\[.5ex] a_x(0)&=-4.000&\\\\qquad a_y(0)&=0.000 \\\\end{alignat*} Thus we may calculate the velocities $v_x(0.05)$ and $v_y(0.05)$: \\\\begin{align*} v_x(0.05) &= 0.000 - 4.000 \\\\times 0.050 = -0.200;\\\\\\\\[1ex] v_y(0.05) &= 1.630 + 0.000 \\\\times 0.050 = \\\\phantom{-}1.630. \\\\end{align*} Now our main calculations begin: \\\\begin{alignat*}{2} x(0.1)&=0.500-0.20 \\\\times 0.1&&=\\\\phantom{-}0.480\\\\\\\\[.5ex] y(0.1)&=0.0+1.63 \\\\times 0.1 &&=\\\\phantom{-}0.163\\\\\\\\[.5ex] r(0.1)&=\\\\sqrt{0.480^2+0.163^2}&&=\\\\phantom{-}0.507\\\\\\\\[.5ex] 1/r^3(0.1)&=7.677 &&\\\\\\\\[.5ex] a_x(0.1)&=-0.480 \\\\times 7.677 &&=-3.685\\\\\\\\[.5ex] a_y(0.1)&=-0.163 \\\\times 7.677 &&=-1.250\\\\\\\\[.5ex] v_x(0.15)&=-0.200-3.685\\\\times0.1 &&=-0.568\\\\\\\\[.5ex] v_y(0.15)&=1.630-1.250\\\\times0.1 &&=\\\\phantom{-}1.505\\\\\\\\[.5ex] x(0.2)&=0.480-0.568\\\\times 0.1&&=\\\\phantom{-}0.423\\\\\\\\[.5ex] y(0.2)&=0.163+1.505\\\\times0.1&&=\\\\phantom{-}0.313\\\\\\\\[.5ex] &\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\text{etc.}&& \\\\end{alignat*} In this way we obtain the values given in Table 9–2, and in $20$ steps or so we have chased the planet halfway around the sun! In Fig. 9–6 are plotted the $x$- and $y$-coordinates given in Table 9–2. The dots represent the positions at the succession of times a tenth of a unit apart; we see that at the start the planet moves rapidly and at the end it moves slowly, and so the shape of the curve is determined. Thus we see that we really do know how to calculate the motion of planets! Solution of $dv_x/dt=-x/r^3$, $dv_y/dt=-y/r^3$, $r=\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Interval: $\\\\epsilon=0.100$ Orbit\\u2001$v_y=1.63$\\u2001$v_x=0$\\u2001$x=0.5$\\u2001$y=0$\\u2001at\\u2001$t=0$ Crossed $x$-axis at $2.101$ sec, $ \\\\therefore$ period${}=4.20$ sec. $v_x=0$ at $2.086$ sec. Cross $x$ at $-1.022$, $ \\\\therefore$ semimajor axis${}=$ $\\\\dfrac{1.022+0.500}{2}$ $=0.761$. $v_y=-0.797$. Predicted time $\\\\pi(0.761)^{3/2}=$ $\\\\pi(0.663)=$ $2.082$. Now let us see how we can calculate the motion of Neptune, Jupiter, Uranus, or any other planet. If we have a great many planets, and let the sun move too, can we do the same thing? Of course we can. We calculate the force on a particular planet, let us say planet number $i$, which has a position $x_i,y_i,z_i$ ($i=1$ may represent the sun, $i=2$ Mercury, $i=3$ Venus, and so on). We must know the positions of all the planets. The force acting on one is due to all the other bodies which are located, let us say, at positions $x_j,y_j,z_j$. Therefore the equations are \\\\begin{align} m_i\\\\,\\\\ddt{v_{ix}}{t}&= \\\\sum_{j=1}^N-\\\\frac{Gm_im_j(x_i-x_j)}{r_{ij}^3},\\\\notag\\\\\\\\ \\\\label{Eq:I:9:18} m_i\\\\,\\\\ddt{v_{iy}}{t}&= \\\\sum_{j=1}^N-\\\\frac{Gm_im_j( y_i- y_j )}{r_{ij}^3},\\\\\\\\ m_i\\\\,\\\\ddt{v_{iz}}{t}&= \\\\sum_{j=1}^N-\\\\frac{Gm_im_j( z_i- z_j )}{r_{ij}^3}.\\\\notag \\\\end{align} Further, we define $r_{ij}$ as the distance between the two planets $i$ and $j$; this is equal to \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:9:19} r_{ij}=\\\\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2+(z_i-z_j)^2}. \\\\end{equation} Also, $\\\\sum$ means a sum over all values of $j$—all other bodies—except, of course, for $j=i$. Thus all we have to do is to make more columns, lots more columns. We need nine columns for the motions of Jupiter, nine for the motions of Saturn, and so on. Then when we have all initial positions and velocities we can calculate all the accelerations from Eq. (9.18) by first calculating all the distances, using Eq. (9.19). How long will it take to do it?  If you do it at home, it will take a very long time! But in modern times we have machines which do arithmetic very rapidly; a very good computing machine may take $1$ microsecond, that is, a millionth of a second, to do an addition. To do a multiplication takes longer, say $10$ microseconds. It may be that in one cycle of calculation, depending on the problem, we may have $30$ multiplications, or something like that, so one cycle will take $300$ microseconds. That means that we can do $3000$ cycles of computation per second. In order to get an accuracy, of, say, one part in a billion, we would need $4\\\\times10^5$ cycles to correspond to one revolution of a planet around the sun. That corresponds to a computation time of $130$ seconds or about two minutes. Thus it takes only two minutes to follow Jupiter around the sun, with all the perturbations of all the planets correct to one part in a billion, by this method! (It turns out that the error varies about as the square of the interval $\\\\epsilon$. If we make the interval a thousand times smaller, it is a million times more accurate. So, let us make the interval $10{,}000$ times smaller.) So, as we said, we began this chapter not knowing how to calculate even the motion of a mass on a spring. Now, armed with the tremendous power of Newton’s laws, we can not only calculate such simple motions but also, given only a machine to handle the arithmetic, even the tremendously complex motions of the planets, to as high a degree of precision as we wish!', metadata={'source': '38', 'row': 38})"

This is not necessarily the case of course, but that is what every professor in every subject assumes! If you are going to be a physicist, you will have a lot to study: two hundred years of the most rapidly developing field of knowledge that there is. So much knowledge, in fact, that you might think that you cannot learn all of it in four years, and truly you cannot; you will have to go to graduate school too! Surprisingly enough, in spite of the tremendous amount of work that has been done for all this time it is possible to condense the enormous mass of results to a large extent—that is, to find laws which summarize all our knowledge. Even so, the laws are so hard to grasp that it is unfair to you to start exploring this tremendous subject without some kind of map or outline of the relationship of one part of the subject of science to another. Following these preliminary remarks, the first three chapters will therefore outline the relation of physics to the rest of the sciences, the relations of the sciences to each other, and the meaning of science, to help us develop a “feel” for the subject. You might ask why we cannot teach physics by just giving the basic laws on page one and then showing how they work in all possible circumstances, as we do in Euclidean geometry, where we state the axioms and then make all sorts of deductions. (So, not satisfied to learn physics in four years, you want to learn it in four minutes?) We cannot do it in this way for two reasons. First, we do not yet know all the basic laws: there is an expanding frontier of ignorance. Second, the correct statement of the laws of physics involves some very unfamiliar ideas which require advanced mathematics for their description. Therefore, one needs a considerable amount of preparatory training even to learn what the words mean. No, it is not possible to do it that way. We can only do it piece by piece. Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximation to the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it. In fact, everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the laws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected. The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: The test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientific “truth.” But what is the source of knowledge? Where do the laws that are to be tested come from? Experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws, in the sense that it gives us hints. But also needed is imagination to create from these hints the great generalizations—to guess at the wonderful, simple, but very strange patterns beneath them all, and then to experiment to check again whether we have made the right guess. This imagining process is so difficult that there is a division of labor in physics: there are theoretical physicists who imagine, deduce, and guess at new laws, but do not experiment; and then there are experimental physicists who experiment, imagine, deduce, and guess. We said that the laws of nature are approximate: that we first find the “wrong” ones, and then we find the “right” ones. Now, how can an experiment be “wrong”? First, in a trivial way: if something is wrong with the apparatus that you did not notice. But these things are easily fixed, and checked back and forth. So without snatching at such minor things, how can the results of an experiment be wrong? Only by being inaccurate. For example, the mass of an object never seems to change: a spinning top has the same weight as a still one. So a “law” was invented: mass is constant, independent of speed. That “law” is now found to be incorrect. Mass is found to increase with velocity, but appreciable increases require velocities near that of light. A true law is: if an object moves with a speed of less than one hundred miles a second the mass is constant to within one part in a million. In some such approximate form this is a correct law. So in practice one might think that the new law makes no significant difference. Well, yes and no. For ordinary speeds we can certainly forget it and use the simple constant-mass law as a good approximation. But for high speeds we are wrong, and the higher the speed, the more wrong we are. Finally, and most interesting, philosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas. Now, what should we teach first? Should we teach the correct but unfamiliar law with its strange and difficult conceptual ideas, for example the theory of relativity, four-dimensional space-time, and so on? Or should we first teach the simple “constant-mass” law, which is only approximate, but does not involve such difficult ideas? The first is more exciting, more wonderful, and more fun, but the second is easier to get at first, and is a first step to a real understanding of the first idea. This point arises again and again in teaching physics. At different times we shall have to resolve it in different ways, but at each stage it is worth learning what is now known, how accurate it is, how it fits into everything else, and how it may be changed when we learn more. Let us now proceed with our outline, or general map, of our understanding of science today (in particular, physics, but also of other sciences on the periphery), so that when we later concentrate on some particular point we will have some idea of the background, why that particular point is interesting, and how it fits into the big structure. So, what is our overall picture of the world?', metadata={'source': '0', 'row': 0})"

            "section_text: In this chapter, we begin our more detailed study of the different aspects of physics, having finished our description of things in general. To illustrate the ideas and the kind of reasoning that might be used in theoretical physics, we shall now examine one of the most basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy. There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law—it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation of energy. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. (Something like the bishop on a red square, and after a number of moves—details unknown—it is still on some red square. It is a law of this nature.) Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it by an analogy. Imagine a child, perhaps “Dennis the Menace,” who has blocks which are absolutely indestructible, and cannot be divided into pieces. Each is the same as the other. Let us suppose that he has $28$ blocks. His mother puts him with his $28$ blocks into a room at the beginning of the day. At the end of the day, being curious, she counts the blocks very carefully, and discovers a phenomenal law—no matter what he does with the blocks, there are always $28$ remaining! This continues for a number of days, until one day there are only $27$ blocks, but a little investigating shows that there is one under the rug—she must look everywhere to be sure that the number of blocks has not changed. One day, however, the number appears to change—there are only $26$ blocks. Careful investigation indicates that the window was open, and upon looking outside, the other two blocks are found. Another day, careful count indicates that there are $30$ blocks! This causes considerable consternation, until it is realized that Bruce came to visit, bringing his blocks with him, and he left a few at Dennis’ house. After she has disposed of the extra blocks, she closes the window, does not let Bruce in, and then everything is going along all right, until one time she counts and finds only $25$ blocks. However, there is a box in the room, a toy box, and the mother goes to open the toy box, but the boy says “No, do not open my toy box,” and screams. Mother is not allowed to open the toy box. Being extremely curious, and somewhat ingenious, she invents a scheme! She knows that a block weighs three ounces, so she weighs the box at a time when she sees $28$ blocks, and it weighs $16$ ounces. The next time she wishes to check, she weighs the box again, subtracts sixteen ounces and divides by three. She discovers the following:  \\begin{equation} \\label{Eq:I:4:1} \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{number of}\\\\ \\text{blocks seen} \\end{pmatrix}+ \\frac{(\\text{weight of box})-\\text{$16$ ounces}}{\\text{$3$ ounces}}= \\text{constant}. \\end{equation} \n",
            " \\begin{align} \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{number of}\\\\ \\text{blocks seen} \\end{pmatrix}&+ \\frac{(\\text{weight of box})-\\text{$16$ ounces}}{\\text{$3$ ounces}}\\notag\\\\[1ex] \\label{Eq:I:4:1} &=\\text{constant}. \\end{align}  There then appear to be some new deviations, but careful study indicates that the dirty water in the bathtub is changing its level. The child is throwing blocks into the water, and she cannot see them because it is so dirty, but she can find out how many blocks are in the water by adding another term to her formula. Since the original height of the water was $6$ inches and each block raises the water a quarter of an inch, this new formula would be:  \\begin{align} \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{number of}\\\\ \\text{blocks seen} \\end{pmatrix}&+ \\frac{(\\text{weight of box})-\\text{$16$ ounces}} {\\text{$3$ ounces}}\\notag\\\\[1ex] \\label{Eq:I:4:2} &+\\frac{(\\text{height of water})-\\text{$6$ inches}} {\\text{$1/4$ inch}}= \\text{constant}. \\end{align} \n",
            " \\begin{align} \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{number of}\\\\ \\text{blocks seen} \\end{pmatrix}&+ \\frac{(\\text{weight of box})-\\text{$16$ ounces}} {\\text{$3$ ounces}}\\notag\\\\[1ex] &+\\frac{(\\text{height of water})-\\text{$6$ inches}} {\\text{$1/4$ inch}}\\notag\\\\[2ex] \\label{Eq:I:4:2} &=\\text{constant}. \\end{align}  In the gradual increase in the complexity of her world, she finds a whole series of terms representing ways of calculating how many blocks are in places where she is not allowed to look. As a result, she finds a complex formula, a quantity which has to be computed, which always stays the same in her situation. What is the analogy of this to the conservation of energy? The most remarkable aspect that must be abstracted from this picture is that there are no blocks. Take away the first terms in (4.1) and (4.2) and we find ourselves calculating more or less abstract things. The analogy has the following points. First, when we are calculating the energy, sometimes some of it leaves the system and goes away, or sometimes some comes in. In order to verify the conservation of energy, we must be careful that we have not put any in or taken any out. Second, the energy has a large number of different forms, and there is a formula for each one. These are: gravitational energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy. If we total up the formulas for each of these contributions, it will not change except for energy going in and out. It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a definite amount. It is not that way. However, there are formulas for calculating some numerical quantity, and when we add it all together it gives “$28$”—always the same number. It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the reasons for the various formulas.\n",
            "section_text: Conservation of energy can be understood only if we have the formula for all of its forms. I wish to discuss the formula for gravitational energy near the surface of the Earth, and I wish to derive this formula in a way which has nothing to do with history but is simply a line of reasoning invented for this particular lecture to give you an illustration of the remarkable fact that a great deal about nature can be extracted from a few facts and close reasoning. It is an illustration of the kind of work theoretical physicists become involved in. It is patterned after a most excellent argument by Mr. Carnot on the efficiency of steam engines.1 Consider weight-lifting machines—machines which have the property that they lift one weight by lowering another. Let us also make a hypothesis: that there is no such thing as perpetual motion with these weight-lifting machines. (In fact, that there is no perpetual motion at all is a general statement of the law of conservation of energy.)  We must be careful to define perpetual motion. First, let us do it for weight-lifting machines. If, when we have lifted and lowered a lot of weights and restored the machine to the original condition, we find that the net result is to have lifted a weight, then we have a perpetual motion machine because we can use that lifted weight to run something else. That is, provided the machine which lifted the weight is brought back to its exact original condition, and furthermore that it is completely self-contained—that it has not received the energy to lift that weight from some external source—like Bruce’s blocks. A very simple weight-lifting machine is shown in Fig. 4–1. This machine lifts weights three units “strong.” We place three units on one balance pan, and one unit on the other. However, in order to get it actually to work, we must lift a little weight off the left pan. On the other hand, we could lift a one-unit weight by lowering the three-unit weight, if we cheat a little by lifting a little weight off the other pan. Of course, we realize that with any actual lifting machine, we must add a little extra to get it to run. This we disregard, temporarily. Ideal machines, although they do not exist, do not require anything extra. A machine that we actually use can be, in a sense, almost reversible: that is, if it will lift the weight of three by lowering a weight of one, then it will also lift nearly the weight of one the same amount by lowering the weight of three. We imagine that there are two classes of machines, those that are not reversible, which includes all real machines, and those that are reversible, which of course are actually not attainable no matter how careful we may be in our design of bearings, levers, etc. We suppose, however, that there is such a thing—a reversible machine—which lowers one unit of weight (a pound or any other unit) by one unit of distance, and at the same time lifts a three-unit weight. Call this reversible machine, Machine $A$. Suppose this particular reversible machine lifts the three-unit weight a distance $X$. Then suppose we have another machine, Machine $B$, which is not necessarily reversible, which also lowers a unit weight a unit distance, but which lifts three units a distance $Y$. We can now prove that $Y$ is not higher than $X$; that is, it is impossible to build a machine that will lift a weight any higher than it will be lifted by a reversible machine. Let us see why. Let us suppose that $Y$ were higher than $X$. We take a one-unit weight and lower it one unit height with Machine $B$, and that lifts the three-unit weight up a distance $Y$. Then we could lower the weight from $Y$ to $X$, obtaining free power, and use the reversible Machine $A$, running backwards, to lower the three-unit weight a distance $X$ and lift the one-unit weight by one unit height. This will put the one-unit weight back where it was before, and leave both machines ready to be used again! We would therefore have perpetual motion if $Y$ were higher than $X$, which we assumed was impossible. With those assumptions, we thus deduce that $Y$ is not higher than $X$, so that of all machines that can be designed, the reversible machine is the best. We can also see that all reversible machines must lift to exactly the same height. Suppose that $B$ were really reversible also. The argument that $Y$ is not higher than $X$ is, of course, just as good as it was before, but we can also make our argument the other way around, using the machines in the opposite order, and prove that $X$ is not higher than $Y$. This, then, is a very remarkable observation because it permits us to analyze the height to which different machines are going to lift something without looking at the interior mechanism. We know at once that if somebody makes an enormously elaborate series of levers that lift three units a certain distance by lowering one unit by one unit distance, and we compare it with a simple lever which does the same thing and is fundamentally reversible, his machine will lift it no higher, but perhaps less high. If his machine is reversible, we also know exactly how high it will lift. To summarize: every reversible machine, no matter how it operates, which drops one pound one foot and lifts a three-pound weight always lifts it the same distance, $X$. This is clearly a universal law of great utility. The next question is, of course, what is $X$? Suppose we have a reversible machine which is going to lift this distance $X$, three for one. We set up three balls in a rack which does not move, as shown in Fig. 4–2. One ball is held on a stage at a distance one foot above the ground. The machine can lift three balls, lowering one by a distance $1$. Now, we have arranged that the platform which holds three balls has a floor and two shelves, exactly spaced at distance $X$, and further, that the rack which holds the balls is spaced at distance $X$, (a). First we roll the balls horizontally from the rack to the shelves, (b), and we suppose that this takes no energy because we do not change the height. The reversible machine then operates: it lowers the single ball to the floor, and it lifts the rack a distance $X$, (c). Now we have ingeniously arranged the rack so that these balls are again even with the platforms. Thus we unload the balls onto the rack, (d); having unloaded the balls, we can restore the machine to its original condition. Now we have three balls on the upper three shelves and one at the bottom. But the strange thing is that, in a certain way of speaking, we have not lifted two of them at all because, after all, there were balls on shelves $2$ and $3$ before. The resulting effect has been to lift one ball a distance $3X$. Now, if $3X$ exceeds one foot, then we can lower the ball to return the machine to the initial condition, (f), and we can run the apparatus again. Therefore $3X$ cannot exceed one foot, for if $3X$ exceeds one foot we can make perpetual motion. Likewise, we can prove that one foot cannot exceed $3X$, by making the whole machine run the opposite way, since it is a reversible machine. Therefore $3X$ is neither greater nor less than a foot, and we discover then, by argument alone, the law that $X=\\tfrac{1}{3}$ foot. The generalization is clear: one pound falls a certain distance in operating a reversible machine; then the machine can lift $p$ pounds this distance divided by $p$. Another way of putting the result is that three pounds times the height lifted, which in our problem was $X$, is equal to one pound times the distance lowered, which is one foot in this case. If we take all the weights and multiply them by the heights at which they are now, above the floor, let the machine operate, and then multiply all the weights by all the heights again, there will be no change. (We have to generalize the example where we moved only one weight to the case where when we lower one we lift several different ones—but that is easy.) We call the sum of the weights times the heights gravitational potential energy—the energy which an object has because of its relationship in space, relative to the earth. The formula for gravitational energy, then, so long as we are not too far from the earth (the force weakens as we go higher) is \\begin{equation} \\label{Eq:I:4:3} \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{gravitational}\\\\ \\text{potential energy}\\\\ \\text{for one object} \\end{pmatrix}= (\\text{weight})\\times(\\text{height}). \\end{equation} It is a very beautiful line of reasoning. The only problem is that perhaps it is not true. (After all, nature does not have to go along with our reasoning.) For example, perhaps perpetual motion is, in fact, possible. Some of the assumptions may be wrong, or we may have made a mistake in reasoning, so it is always necessary to check. It turns out experimentally, in fact, to be true. The general name of energy which has to do with location relative to something else is called potential energy. In this particular case, of course, we call it gravitational potential energy. If it is a question of electrical forces against which we are working, instead of gravitational forces, if we are “lifting” charges away from other charges with a lot of levers, then the energy content is called electrical potential energy. The general principle is that the change in the energy is the force times the distance that the force is pushed, and that this is a change in energy in general: \\begin{equation} \\label{Eq:I:4:4}  \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{change in}\\\\ \\text{energy} \\end{pmatrix}= (\\text{force})\\times  \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{distance force}\\\\ \\text{acts through} \\end{pmatrix}. \\end{equation} We will return to many of these other kinds of energy as we continue the course. The principle of the conservation of energy is very useful for deducing what will happen in a number of circumstances. In high school we learned a lot of laws about pulleys and levers used in different ways. We can now see that these “laws” are all the\n",
            "section_text: We can continue in this way to illustrate the existence of energy in other forms. First, consider elastic energy. If we pull down on a spring, we must do some work, for when we have it down, we can lift weights with it. Therefore in its stretched condition it has a possibility of doing some work. If we were to evaluate the sums of weights times heights, it would not check out—we must add something else to account for the fact that the spring is under tension. Elastic energy is the formula for a spring when it is stretched. How much energy is it? If we let go, the elastic energy, as the spring passes through the equilibrium point, is converted to kinetic energy and it goes back and forth between compressing or stretching the spring and kinetic energy of motion. (There is also some gravitational energy going in and out, but we can do this experiment “sideways” if we like.) It keeps going until the losses—Aha! We have cheated all the way through by putting on little weights to move things or saying that the machines are reversible, or that they go on forever, but we can see that things do stop, eventually. Where is the energy when the spring has finished moving up and down? This brings in another form of energy: heat energy. Inside a spring or a lever there are crystals which are made up of lots of atoms, and with great care and delicacy in the arrangement of the parts one can try to adjust things so that as something rolls on something else, none of the atoms do any jiggling at all. But one must be very careful. Ordinarily when things roll, there is bumping and jiggling because of the irregularities of the material, and the atoms start to wiggle inside. So we lose track of that energy; we find the atoms are wiggling inside in a random and confused manner after the motion slows down. There is still kinetic energy, all right, but it is not associated with visible motion. What a dream! How do we know there is still kinetic energy? It turns out that with thermometers you can find out that, in fact, the spring or the lever is warmer, and that there is really an increase of kinetic energy by a definite amount. We call this form of energy heat energy, but we know that it is not really a new form, it is just kinetic energy—internal motion. (One of the difficulties with all these experiments with matter that we do on a large scale is that we cannot really demonstrate the conservation of energy and we cannot really make our reversible machines, because every time we move a large clump of stuff, the atoms do not remain absolutely undisturbed, and so a certain amount of random motion goes into the atomic system. We cannot see it, but we can measure it with thermometers, etc.) There are many other forms of energy, and of course we cannot describe them in any more detail just now. There is electrical energy, which has to do with pushing and pulling by electric charges. There is radiant energy, the energy of light, which we know is a form of electrical energy because light can be represented as wigglings in the electromagnetic field. There is chemical energy, the energy which is released in chemical reactions. Actually, elastic energy is, to a certain extent, like chemical energy, because chemical energy is the energy of the attraction of the atoms, one for the other, and so is elastic energy. Our modern understanding is the following: chemical energy has two parts, kinetic energy of the electrons inside the atoms, so part of it is kinetic, and electrical energy of interaction of the electrons and the protons—the rest of it, therefore, is electrical. Next we come to nuclear energy, the energy which is involved with the arrangement of particles inside the nucleus, and we have formulas for that, but we do not have the fundamental laws. We know that it is not electrical, not gravitational, and not purely kinetic, but we do not know what it is. It seems to be an additional form of energy. Finally, associated with the relativity theory, there is a modification of the laws of kinetic energy, or whatever you wish to call it, so that kinetic energy is combined with another thing called mass energy. An object has energy from its sheer existence. If I have a positron and an electron, standing still doing nothing—never mind gravity, never mind anything—and they come together and disappear, radiant energy will be liberated, in a definite amount, and the amount can be calculated. All we need know is the mass of the object. It does not depend on what it is—we make two things disappear, and we get a certain amount of energy. The formula was first found by Einstein; it is $E=mc^2$.  It is obvious from our discussion that the law of conservation of energy is enormously useful in making analyses, as we have illustrated in a few examples without knowing all the formulas. If we had all the formulas for all kinds of energy, we could analyze how many processes should work without having to go into the details. Therefore conservation laws are very interesting. The question naturally arises as to what other conservation laws there are in physics. There are two other conservation laws which are analogous to the conservation of energy. One is called the conservation of linear momentum. The other is called the conservation of angular momentum. We will find out more about these later. In the last analysis, we do not understand the conservation laws deeply. We do not understand the conservation of energy. We do not understand energy as a certain number of little blobs. You may have heard that photons come out in blobs and that the energy of a photon is Planck’s constant times the frequency. That is true, but since the frequency of light can be anything, there is no law that says that energy has to be a certain definite amount. Unlike Dennis’ blocks, there can be any amount of energy, at least as presently understood. So we do not understand this energy as counting something at the moment, but just as a mathematical quantity, which is an abstract and rather peculiar circumstance. In quantum mechanics it turns out that the conservation of energy is very closely related to another important property of the world, things do not depend on the absolute time. We can set up an experiment at a given moment and try it out, and then do the same experiment at a later moment, and it will behave in exactly the same way. Whether this is strictly true or not, we do not know. If we assume that it is true, and add the principles of quantum mechanics, then we can deduce the principle of the conservation of energy. It is a rather subtle and interesting thing, and it is not easy to explain. The other conservation laws are also linked together. The conservation of momentum is associated in quantum mechanics with the proposition that it makes no difference where you do the experiment, the results will always be the same. As independence in space has to do with the conservation of momentum, independence of time has to do with the conservation of energy, and finally, if we turn our apparatus, this too makes no difference, and so the invariance of the world to angular orientation is related to the conservation of angular momentum. Besides these, there are three other conservation laws, that are exact so far as we can tell today, which are much simpler to understand because they are in the nature of counting blocks.  The first of the three is the conservation of charge, and that merely means that you count how many positive, minus how many negative electrical charges you have, and the number is never changed. You may get rid of a positive with a negative, but you do not create any net excess of positives over negatives. Two other laws are analogous to this one—one is called the conservation of baryons. There are a number of strange particles, a neutron and a proton are examples, which are called baryons. In any reaction whatever in nature, if we count how many baryons are coming into a process, the number of baryons3 which come out will be exactly the same. There is another law, the conservation of leptons. We can say that the group of particles called leptons are: electron, muon, and neutrino. There is an antielectron which is a positron, that is, a $-1$ lepton. Counting the total number of leptons in a reaction reveals that the number in and out never changes, at least so far as we know at present. These are the six conservation laws, three of them subtle, involving space and time, and three of them simple, in the sense of counting something. With regard to the conservation of energy, we should note that available energy is another matter—there is a lot of jiggling around in the atoms of the water of the sea, because the sea has a certain temperature, but it is impossible to get them herded into a definite motion without taking energy from somewhere else. That is, although we know for a fact that energy is conserved, the energy available for human utility is not conserved so easily. The laws which govern how much energy is available are called the laws of thermodynamics and involve a concept called entropy for irreversible thermodynamic processes. Finally, we remark on the question of where we can get our supplies of energy today. Our supplies of energy are from the sun, rain, coal, uranium, and hydrogen. The sun makes the rain, and the coal also, so that all these are from the sun. Although energy is conserved, nature does not seem to be interested in it; she liberates a lot of energy from the sun, but only one part in two billion falls on the earth. Nature has conservation of energy, but does not really care; she spends a lot of it in all directions. We have already obtained energy from uranium; we can also get energy from hydrogen, but at present only in an explosive and dangerous condition. If it can be controlled in thermonuclear reactions, it turns out that the energy that can be obtained from $10$ quarts of water per second is equal to all of the electrical\n",

            "section_text: In Chapter 4 we discussed the conservation of energy. In that discussion, we did not use Newton’s laws, but it is, of course, of great interest to see how it comes about that energy is in fact conserved in accordance with these laws. For clarity we shall start with the simplest possible example, and then develop harder and harder examples.  The simplest example of the conservation of energy is a vertically falling object, one that moves only in a vertical direction. An object which changes its height under the influence of gravity alone has a kinetic energy $T$ (or K.E.) due to its motion during the fall, and a potential energy $mgh$, abbreviated $U$ (or P.E.), whose sum is constant: \\begin{equation} \\underset{\\text{K.E.}}{\\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2}+ \\underset{\\text{P.E.}}{\\vphantom{\\tfrac{1}{2}}mgh}=\\text{const},\\notag \\end{equation} or \\begin{equation} \\label{Eq:I:13:1} T+U=\\text{const}. \\end{equation} Now we would like to show that this statement is true. What do we mean, show it is true? From Newton’s Second Law we can easily tell how the object moves, and it is easy to find out how the velocity varies with time, namely, that it increases proportionally with the time, and that the height varies as the square of the time. So if we measure the height from a zero point where the object is stationary, it is no miracle that the height turns out to be equal to the square of the velocity times a number of constants. However, let us look at it a little more closely. Let us find out directly from Newton’s Second Law how the kinetic energy should change, by taking the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to time and then using Newton’s laws. When we differentiate $\\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$ with respect to time, we obtain \\begin{equation} \\label{Eq:I:13:2} \\ddt{T}{t}=\\ddt{}{t}\\,(\\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2)= \\tfrac{1}{2}m2v\\,\\ddt{v}{t}=mv\\,\\ddt{v}{t}, \\end{equation} since $m$ is assumed constant. But from Newton’s Second Law, $m(dv/dt)=F$, so that \\begin{equation} \\label{Eq:I:13:3} dT/dt = Fv. \\end{equation} In general, it will come out to be $\\FLPF\\cdot\\FLPv$, but in our one-dimensional case let us leave it as the force times the velocity. Now in our simple example the force is constant, equal to $-mg$, a vertical force (the minus sign means that it acts downward), and the velocity, of course, is the rate of change of the vertical position, or height $h$, with time. Thus the rate of change of the kinetic energy is $-mg(dh/dt)$, which quantity, miracle of miracles, is minus the rate of change of something else! It is minus the time rate of change of $mgh$!  Therefore, as time goes on, the changes in kinetic energy and in the quantity $mgh$ are equal and opposite, so that the sum of the two quantities remains constant. Q.E.D. We have shown, from Newton’s second law of motion, that energy is conserved for constant forces when we add the potential energy $mgh$ to the kinetic energy $\\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$. Now let us look into this further and see whether it can be generalized, and thus advance our understanding. Does it work only for a freely falling body, or is it more general? We expect from our discussion of the conservation of energy that it would work for an object moving from one point to another in some kind of frictionless curve, under the influence of gravity (Fig. 13–1). If the object reaches a certain height $h$ from the original height $H$, then the same formula should again be right, even though the velocity is now in some direction other than the vertical. We would like to understand why the law is still correct. Let us follow the same analysis, finding the time rate of change of the kinetic energy. This will again be $mv(dv/dt)$, but $m(dv/dt)$ is the rate of change of the magnitude of the momentum, i.e., the force in the direction of motion—the tangential force $F_t$. Thus \\begin{equation*} \\ddt{T}{t}=mv\\,\\ddt{v}{t}=F_tv. \\end{equation*} Now the speed is the rate of change of distance along the curve, $ds/dt$, and the tangential force $F_t$ is not $-mg$ but is weaker by the ratio of the vertical distance $dh$ to the distance $ds$ along the path. In other words, \\begin{equation*} F_t=-mg\\sin\\theta=-mg\\,\\ddt{h}{s}, \\end{equation*} so that \\begin{equation*} F_t\\,\\ddt{s}{t}=-mg\\biggl(\\ddt{h}{s}\\biggr) \\biggl(\\ddt{s}{t}\\biggr)=-mg\\,\\ddt{h}{t}, \\end{equation*} since the $ds$’s cancel. Thus we get $-mg(dh/dt)$, which is equal to the rate of change of $-mgh$, as before. In order to understand exactly how the conservation of energy works in general in mechanics, we shall now discuss a number of concepts which will help us to analyze it. First, we discuss the rate of change of kinetic energy in general in three dimensions. The kinetic energy in three dimensions is \\begin{equation*} T=\\tfrac{1}{2}m(v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2). \\end{equation*} When we differentiate this with respect to time, we get three terrifying terms: \\begin{equation} \\label{Eq:I:13:4} \\ddt{T}{t}=m\\biggl( v_x\\,\\ddt{v_x}{t}+ v_y\\,\\ddt{v_y}{t}+ v_z\\,\\ddt{v_z}{t} \\biggr). \\end{equation} But $m(dv_x/dt)$ is the force $F_x$ acting on the object in the $x$-direction. Thus the right side of Eq. (13.4) is $F_xv_x + F_yv_y + F_zv_z$. We recall our vector analysis and recognize this as $\\FLPF\\cdot\\FLPv$; therefore \\begin{equation} \\label{Eq:I:13:5} dT/dt=\\FLPF\\cdot\\FLPv. \\end{equation} This result can be derived more quickly as follows: if $\\FLPa$ and $\\FLPb$ are two vectors, both of which may depend upon the time, the derivative of $\\FLPa\\cdot\\FLPb$ is, in general, \\begin{equation} \\label{Eq:I:13:6} d(\\FLPa\\cdot\\FLPb)/dt=\\FLPa\\cdot(d\\FLPb/dt)+(d\\FLPa/dt)\\cdot\\FLPb. \\end{equation} We then use this in the form $\\FLPa =$ $\\FLPb =$ $\\FLPv$:  \\begin{equation} \\label{Eq:I:13:7} \\ddt{(\\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2)}{t}=\\ddt{(\\tfrac{1}{2}m\\FLPv\\cdot\\FLPv)}{t}= m\\,\\ddt{\\FLPv}{t}\\cdot\\FLPv=\\FLPF\\cdot\\FLPv=\\FLPF\\cdot\\ddt{\\FLPs}{t}. \\end{equation} \n",

To illustrate the ideas and the kind of reasoning that might be used in theoretical physics, we shall now examine one of the most basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy. There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law—it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation of energy. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. (Something like the bishop on a red square, and after a number of moves—details unknown—it is still on some red square. It is a law of this nature.) Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it by an analogy. Imagine a child, perhaps “Dennis the Menace,” who has blocks which are absolutely indestructible, and cannot be divided into pieces. Each is the same as the other. Let us suppose that he has $28$ blocks. His mother puts him with his $28$ blocks into a room at the beginning of the day. At the end of the day, being curious, she counts the blocks very carefully, and discovers a phenomenal law—no matter what he does with the blocks, there are always $28$ remaining! This continues for a number of days, until one day there are only $27$ blocks, but a little investigating shows that there is one under the rug—she must look everywhere to be sure that the number of blocks has not changed. One day, however, the number appears to change—there are only $26$ blocks. Careful investigation indicates that the window was open, and upon looking outside, the other two blocks are found. Another day, careful count indicates that there are $30$ blocks! This causes considerable consternation, until it is realized that Bruce came to visit, bringing his blocks with him, and he left a few at Dennis’ house. After she has disposed of the extra blocks, she closes the window, does not let Bruce in, and then everything is going along all right, until one time she counts and finds only $25$ blocks. However, there is a box in the room, a toy box, and the mother goes to open the toy box, but the boy says “No, do not open my toy box,” and screams. Mother is not allowed to open the toy box. Being extremely curious, and somewhat ingenious, she invents a scheme! She knows that a block weighs three ounces, so she weighs the box at a time when she sees $28$ blocks, and it weighs $16$ ounces. The next time she wishes to check, she weighs the box again, subtracts sixteen ounces and divides by three. She discovers the following:  \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:4:1} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\text{number of}\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{blocks seen} \\\\end{pmatrix}+ \\\\frac{(\\\\text{weight of box})-\\\\text{$16$ ounces}}{\\\\text{$3$ ounces}}= \\\\text{constant}. \\\\end{equation} \\n \\\\begin{align} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\text{number of}\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{blocks seen} \\\\end{pmatrix}&+ \\\\frac{(\\\\text{weight of box})-\\\\text{$16$ ounces}}{\\\\text{$3$ ounces}}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\[1ex] \\\\label{Eq:I:4:1} &=\\\\text{constant}. \\\\end{align}  There then appear to be some new deviations, but careful study indicates that the dirty water in the bathtub is changing its level. The child is throwing blocks into the water, and she cannot see them because it is so dirty, but she can find out how many blocks are in the water by adding another term to her formula. Since the original height of the water was $6$ inches and each block raises the water a quarter of an inch, this new formula would be:  \\\\begin{align} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\text{number of}\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{blocks seen} \\\\end{pmatrix}&+ \\\\frac{(\\\\text{weight of box})-\\\\text{$16$ ounces}} {\\\\text{$3$ ounces}}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\[1ex] \\\\label{Eq:I:4:2} &+\\\\frac{(\\\\text{height of water})-\\\\text{$6$ inches}} {\\\\text{$1/4$ inch}}= \\\\text{constant}. \\\\end{align} \\n \\\\begin{align} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\text{number of}\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{blocks seen} \\\\end{pmatrix}&+ \\\\frac{(\\\\text{weight of box})-\\\\text{$16$ ounces}} {\\\\text{$3$ ounces}}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\[1ex] &+\\\\frac{(\\\\text{height of water})-\\\\text{$6$ inches}} {\\\\text{$1/4$ inch}}\\\\notag\\\\\\\\[2ex] \\\\label{Eq:I:4:2} &=\\\\text{constant}. \\\\end{align}  In the gradual increase in the complexity of her world, she finds a whole series of terms representing ways of calculating how many blocks are in places where she is not allowed to look. As a result, she finds a complex formula, a quantity which has to be computed, which always stays the same in her situation. What is the analogy of this to the conservation of energy? The most remarkable aspect that must be abstracted from this picture is that there are no blocks. Take away the first terms in (4.1) and (4.2) and we find ourselves calculating more or less abstract things. The analogy has the following points. First, when we are calculating the energy, sometimes some of it leaves the system and goes away, or sometimes some comes in. In order to verify the conservation of energy, we must be careful that we have not put any in or taken any out. Second, the energy has a large number of different forms, and there is a formula for each one. These are: gravitational energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy. If we total up the formulas for each of these contributions, it will not change except for energy going in and out. It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a definite amount. It is not that way. However, there are formulas for calculating some numerical quantity, and when we add it all together it gives “$28$”—always the same number. It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the reasons for the various formulas.', metadata={'source': '6', 'row': 6})"

We thus have a marvelous theorem: the rate of change of kinetic energy of an object is equal to the power expended by the forces acting on it. However, to study the conservation of energy, we want to analyze this still more closely. Let us evaluate the change in kinetic energy in a very short time $dt$. If we multiply both sides of Eq. (13.7) by $dt$, we find that the differential change in the kinetic energy is the force “dot” the differential distance moved: \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:13:8} dT=\\\\FLPF\\\\cdot d\\\\FLPs. \\\\end{equation} If we now integrate, we get \\\\begin{equation} \\\\label{Eq:I:13:9}\\n\\nof the kinetic and potential energy of a thing may be internal, for instance the internal molecular motions, in the sense that we do not notice it. We know that in a glass of water everything is jiggling around, all the parts are moving all the time, so there is a certain kinetic energy inside, which we ordinarily may not pay any attention to. We do not notice the motion of the atoms, which produces heat, and so we do not call it kinetic energy, but heat is primarily kinetic energy. Internal potential energy may also be in the form, for instance, of chemical energy: when we burn gasoline energy is liberated because the potential energies of the atoms in the new atomic arrangement are lower than in the old arrangement. It is not strictly possible to treat heat as being pure kinetic energy, for a little of the potential gets in, and vice versa for chemical energy, so we put the two together and say that the total kinetic and potential energy inside an object is partly heat, partly\\n\\nNow let us go on to discuss dynamics further. In the analogy between linear motion and angular motion that we discussed in Chapter 18, we used the work theorem, but we did not talk about kinetic energy. What is the kinetic energy of a rigid body, rotating about a certain axis with an angular velocity $\\\\omega$? We can immediately guess the correct answer by using our analogies. The moment of inertia corresponds to the mass, angular velocity corresponds to velocity, and so the kinetic energy ought to be $\\\\tfrac{1}{2}I\\\\omega^2$, and indeed it is, as will now be demonstrated.  Suppose the object is rotating about some axis so that each point has a velocity whose magnitude is $\\\\omega r_i$, where $r_i$ is the radius from the particular point to the axis.  Then if $m_i$ is the mass of that point, the total kinetic energy of the whole thing is just the sum of the kinetic energies of all of the little pieces: \\\\begin{equation*} T=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sum m_iv_i^2= \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sum m_i(r_i\\\\omega)^2.\\n\\nis equal to the kinetic energy brought in. This means, of course, that energy has inertia. In the last chapter we discussed the heating of a gas, and showed that because the gas molecules are moving and moving things are heavier, when we put energy into the gas its molecules move faster and so the gas gets heavier. But in fact the argument is completely general, and our discussion of the inelastic collision shows that the mass is there whether or not it is kinetic energy. In other words, if two particles come together and produce potential or any other form of energy; if the pieces are slowed down by climbing hills, doing work against internal forces, or whatever; then it is still true that the mass is the total energy that has been put in. So we see that the conservation of mass which we have deduced above is equivalent to the conservation of energy, and therefore there is no place in the theory of relativity for strictly inelastic collisions, as there was in Newtonian mechanics.\\n\\nQuestion: what is the kinetic energy\\nHelpful Answer: The kinetic energy of a rigid body, rotating about a certain axis with an angular velocity $\\\\omega$, is $\\\\tfrac{1}{2}I\\\\omega^2$.\\n\\nHint: Think about the analogy between linear motion and angular motion.\\n\\nNote: Please use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

We thus have a marvelous theorem: the rate of change of kinetic energy of an object is equal to the power expended by the forces acting on it. However, to study the conservation of energy, we want to analyze this still more closely. Let us evaluate the change in kinetic energy in a very short time $dt$. If we multiply both sides of Eq.

We know that in a glass of water everything is jiggling around, all the parts are moving all the time, so there is a certain kinetic energy inside, which we ordinarily may not pay any attention to. We do not notice the motion of the atoms, which produces heat, and so we do not call it kinetic energy, but heat is primarily kinetic energy. Internal potential energy may also be in the form, for instance, of chemical energy: when we burn gasoline energy is liberated because the potential energies of the atoms in the new atomic arrangement are lower than in the old arrangement. It is not strictly possible to treat heat as being pure kinetic energy, for a little of the potential gets in, and vice versa for chemical energy, so we put the two together and say that the total kinetic and potential energy inside an object is partly heat, partly', metadata={'source': '/content/output.json', 'seq_num': 27}),\n",

In the analogy between linear motion and angular motion that we discussed in Chapter 18, we used the work theorem, but we did not talk about kinetic energy. What is the kinetic energy of a rigid body, rotating about a certain axis with an angular velocity $\\\\omega$? We can immediately guess the correct answer by using our analogies. The moment of inertia corresponds to the mass, angular velocity corresponds to velocity, and so the kinetic energy ought to be $\\\\tfrac{1}{2}I\\\\omega^2$, and indeed it is, as will now be demonstrated.  Suppose the object is rotating about some axis so that each point has a velocity whose magnitude is $\\\\omega r_i$, where $r_i$ is the radius from the particular point to the axis.  Then if $m_i$ is the mass of that point, the total kinetic energy of the whole thing is just the sum of the kinetic energies of all of the little pieces: \\\\begin{equation*} T=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sum m_iv_i^2= \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sum m_i(r_i\\\\omega)^2.', metadata={'source': '/content/output.json', 'seq_num': 55}),\n",

In the last chapter we discussed the heating of a gas, and showed that because the gas molecules are moving and moving things are heavier, when we put energy into the gas its molecules move faster and so the gas gets heavier. But in fact the argument is completely general, and our discussion of the inelastic collision shows that the mass is there whether or not it is kinetic energy. In other words, if two particles come together and produce potential or any other form of energy; if the pieces are slowed down by climbing hills, doing work against internal forces, or whatever; then it is still true that the mass is the total energy that has been put in. So we see that the conservation of mass which we have deduced above is equivalent to the conservation of energy, and therefore there is no place in the theory of relativity for strictly inelastic collisions, as there was in Newtonian mechanics.', metadata={'source': '/content/output.json', 'seq_num': 42})]}"
