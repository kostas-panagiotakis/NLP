        "An alternative approach to text splitting is being explored to enhance the algorithm's overall performance. It initially divides the text into sentences and then merges those that are semantically similar if they appear consecutively. At a high level, this splits into sentences, then groups into groups of 3 sentences, and then merges one that are similar in the embedding space. The main idea is that semantically similar chunks should be held together.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Purpose and Functionality:The vector store serves as a repository for structured documents that have been parsed into a format suitable for efficient querying and retrieval. It leverages FAISS, a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, to organize and index the documents based on their embeddings. The primary purpose of the vector store is to enable fast and effective similarity searches over the embedded documents, facilitating tasks such as information retrieval, recommendation systems, and similarity-based analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Underlying Technology - FAISS:FAISS is a widely-used library developed by Facebook AI Research for efficient similarity search and clustering in large-scale datasets.It provides various indexing methods optimized for both CPU and GPU architectures, enabling fast and scalable similarity search operations. FAISS is known for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional vector data, making it well-suited for applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Selection of Embeddings Model: The vector store is set up with embeddings generated by the OpenAI embeddings model, specifically the 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model.These embeddings are obtained by encoding the documents using the specified pre-trained language model, capturing semantic information and contextual representations of the text. It's crucial to ensure consistency between the embeddings model used for indexing (creating the vector store) and the one used for querying, as mismatched embeddings may lead to suboptimal search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "* CacheBackedEmbeddings for Optimization: To optimize the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of embedding queries, a CacheBackedEmbeddingsflow is employed. This flow caches previously computed embeddings, preventing redundant embeddings for similar queries and conserving both time and embedding tokens. By reducing redundant embeddings, this approach can significantly lower the computational overhead and overall cost associated with processing queries, especially for frequently occurring or similar queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Storage Considerations:The vector store may require significant storage resources, especially when dealing with large volumes of documents or high-dimensional embeddings. In this example, a LocalFileStore is used to manage the cached embeddings, storing them locally on the file system. It's essential to consider the trade-offs between storage cost and query performance when designing the vector store, as storing cached embeddings incurs additional storage overhead.\n",
