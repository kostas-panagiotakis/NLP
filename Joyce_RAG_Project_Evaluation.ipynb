        "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a language generation paradigm that combines elements of information retrieval and text generation. In this approach, a language generation model is coupled with an information retrieval system that provides relevant context for text generation. In this way the generation model then uses both the context provided by the retrieval and its own knowledge to produce coherent and informative text.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we used LLAMMA as the base language model. Additionally, we incorporated context from James Joyce's \"Ulysses\".\n",
        "\n",
        "We utilized two types of text splitters, namely semantic and recursive text splitters, both sourced from Hugging Face (with some small adaptations in the latter case).\n",
        "\n",
        "In our project, we employed several models for the vector store, focusing on three in particular. Subsequently, we explored various methods for calculating the distance between two document embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the end, we evaluated the results by assigning scores ranging from 1 to 3. By scoring based on the quality and relevance of the obtained results, we could pinpoint the most suitable configurations for our specific goal.\n"

James Joyce's works are celebrated for their modernist and experimental narrative styles, which often explore themes such as identity, alienation, and the human condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "The domain encompasses literature, linguistics, and cultural studies, offering insights into the literary techniques and themes prevalent in Joyce's writing and the broader context of early 20th-century literature in Ireland and beyond.\n",

        "The dataset comprises a text file, containing a literary work by James Joyce. T The in particular the file \"james-joyce-ulysses.txt\" contains Joyce's renowned novel \"Ulysses,\" which is celebrated for its experimental narrative style. The text file is loaded into memory and processed individually, with the number of strings in each file varying based on its length and content.\n",

        "* Preprocessing Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Special Character Removal: All special characters, including slashes (//) and carriage returns (//r), were removed to ensure text cleanliness and uniformity.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Lowercasing: Every word in the text was converted to lowercase to maintain consistency and improve the performance of NLP models.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Text Splitting: Text was splitted into many into Document objects suitable for use with HuggingFace and FAISS, facilitating efficient text retrieval and embedding generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Chunk selection: Every chunk was filtered through to obtain only the relevant sections of texts partaining to James Joyce's work. Everything else was removed from the dataset. ex.: Introduction, conclusion of publisher\n",

        "* Document Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * The texts were divided into logical chunks, each represented as a Document object. These Document objects are structured to be compatible with HuggingFace's transformers and FAISS for efficient similarity search and retrieval-augmented generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * This dataset is intended for tasks involving text retrieval, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation. It is suitable for experiments in NLP, focusing on tasks such as text generation, question answering, and literary analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * The inclusion of James Joyce’s texts provides a rich and challenging dataset due to the complex and varied linguistic styles present in his works.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * This dataset serves as a valuable resource for studying advanced NLP models' ability to understand and generate text based on high-literary content."

The splitter attempts to divide the text using the text characters sequentially until the resulting chunks reach a fixed size.

This strategy aims to maintain the cohesion of paragraphs, sentences, and words, as they typically represent the most semantically related units of text."

Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.\\r\",\"Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:\\r\",\"\\r\",\"—The bard's noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.\\r\",\"You can almost taste it, can't you?\\r\",\"\\r\",\"He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair\\r\",\"oakpale hair stirring slightly.\\r\",\"\\r\",\"—God! he said quietly.

Ask me, sir.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—O, ask me, sir.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—A hard one, sir.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—This is the riddle, Stephen said:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking\\\\r\",\"eleven. \\'Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"What is that?\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—What, sir?\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Again, sir.

We give it up.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Stephen, his throat itching, answered:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries\\\\r\",\"echoed dismay.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Hockey!\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly\\\\r\",\"they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and\\\\r\",\"clamour of their boots and tongues.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open\\\\r\",\"copybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness\\\\r\",\"and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his\\\\r\",\"cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent\\\\r\",\"and damp as a snail\\'s bed.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"He held out his copybook. The word Sums was written on the headline.\\\\r\",\"Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with\\\\r\",\"blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to\\\\r\",\"you, sir.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to\\\\r\",\"copy them off the board, sir.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—No, sir.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a\\\\r\",\"snail\\'s bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her\\\\r\",\"heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him\\\\r\",\"underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery\\\\r\",\"blood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in\\\\r\",\"life? His mother\\'s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal\\\\r\",\"bestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the\\\\r\",\"fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from\\\\r\",\"being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul\\\\r\",\"gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of\\\\r\",\"rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth,\\\\r\",\"listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.

Can you work the second for yourself?\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Yes, sir.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word\\\\r\",\"of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of\\\\r\",\"shame flickering behind his dull skin. Amor matris: subjective and\\\\r\",\"objective genitive.

Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of\\\\r\",\"all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud\\\\r\",\"promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on\\\\r\",\"the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on\\\\r\",\"the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness\\\\r\",\"the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to\\\\r\",\"the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening\\\\r\",\"scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and\\\\r\",\"oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy\\\\r\",\"chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy\\\\r\",\"Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and\\\\r\",\"Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with\\\\r\",\"caps to match and the name H.M.S.', metadata={'source': '/content/output.json', 'seq_num': 1347}), Document(page_content='Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy\\\\r\",\"and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and\\\\r\",\"spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with\\\\r\",\"bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in\\\\r\",\"the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do,\\\\r\",\"or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And\\\\r\",\"Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while\\\\r\",\"that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven\\\\r\",\"months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just\\\\r\",\"beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to\\\\r\",\"him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of\\\\r\",\"water.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"And baby prattled after her:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—A jink a jink a jawbo.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,\\\\r\",\"so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to\\\\r\",\"take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and\\\\r\",\"promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden\\\\r\",\"syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby\\\\r\",\"Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy\\\\r\",\"bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy\\\\r\",\"Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with\\\\r\",\"a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe\\\\r\",\"red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at\\\\r\",\"the quaint language of little brother.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and\\\\r\",\"Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to\\\\r\",\"this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand\\\\r\",\"which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go\\\\r\",\"wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the\\\\r\",\"Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was\\\\r\",\"selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman\\'s house\\\\r\",\"is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the\\\\r\",\"wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle\\\\r\",\"too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the\\\\r\",\"attention of the girl friends.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,\\\\r\",\"Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I\\\\r\",\"catch you for that.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their\\\\r\",\"big sister\\'s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was too\\\\r\",\"after his misadventure. His little man-o\\'-war top and unmentionables\\\\r\",\"were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing\\\\r\",\"over life\\'s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to\\\\r\",\"be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening\\\\r\",\"with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and\\\\r\",\"shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him\\\\r\",\"she wouldn\\'t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—What\\'s your name? Butter and cream?\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your\\\\r\",\"sweetheart?\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Nao, tearful Tommy said.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Nao, Tommy said.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her\\\\r\",\"shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy\\'s sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy\\'s\\\\r\",\"sweetheart.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Cissy\\'s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy\\\\r\",\"Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman\\\\r\",\"couldn\\'t see and to mind he didn\\'t wet his new tan shoes.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"But who was Gerty?\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,\\\\r\",\"gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen\\\\r\",\"of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced\\\\r\",\"beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more\\\\r\",\"a Giltrap than a MacDowell.', metadata={'source': '/content/output.json', 'seq_num': 1348}), Document(page_content='Her figure was slight and graceful,\\\\r\",\"inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking\\\\r\",\"of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch\\'s\\\\r\",\"female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get\\\\r\",\"and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost\\\\r\",\"spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine\\\\r\",\"Cupid\\'s bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster\\\\r\",\"with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments\\\\r\",\"could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves\\\\r\",\"in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to\\\\r\",\"Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn\\\\r\",\"with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to\\\\r\",\"time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever\\\\r\",\"she did that it was her that told her or she\\'d never speak to her again.\\\\r\",\"No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a\\\\r\",\"languid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in\\\\r\",\"her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her\\\\r\",\"to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she\\\\r\",\"only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might\\\\r\",\"easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen\\\\r\",\"herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors\\\\r\",\"at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. Mayhap\\\\r\",\"it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her\\\\r\",\"softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,\\\\r\",\"that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm\\\\r\",\"few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty\\'s were of\\\\r\",\"the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive\\\\r\",\"brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was\\\\r\",\"Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the\\\\r\",\"Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which\\\\r\",\"gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of\\\\r\",\"fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing\\\\r\",\"scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you\\\\r\",\"have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because\\\\r\",\"she had a button one. But Gerty\\'s crowning glory was her wealth of\\\\r\",\"wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut\\\\r\",\"it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her\\\\r\",\"pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails\\\\r\",\"too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy\\'s words as a telltale\\\\r\",\"flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she\\\\r\",\"looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God\\'s\\\\r\",\"fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was\\\\r\",\"about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.\\\\r\",\"Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.\\\\r\",\"The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into\\\\r\",\"a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May\\\\r\",\"morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say\\\\r\",\"that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a\\\\r\",\"lovers\\' quarrel. As per usual somebody\\'s nose was out of joint about the\\\\r\",\"boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and\\\\r\",\"down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the\\\\r\",\"evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was\\\\r\",\"on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when\\\\r\",\"he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in\\\\r\",\"the bicycle races in Trinity college university.

All Tuesday week afternoon\\\\r\",\"she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she\\\\r\",\"wanted at Clery\\'s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you\\\\r\",\"would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by\\\\r\",\"herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the\\\\r\",\"lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it\\\\r\",\"on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the\\\\r\",\"shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in\\\\r\",\"footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she\\\\r\",\"never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak\\\\r\",\"or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her\\\\r\",\"higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect\\\\r\",\"proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of\\\\r\",\"her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and\\\\r\",\"wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty\\'s chief care and who\\\\r\",\"that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though\\\\r\",\"Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame\\\\r\",\"her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three\\\\r\",\"garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different\\\\r\",\"coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired\\\\r\",\"them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed\\\\r\",\"them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn\\'t\\\\r\",\"trust those washerwomen as far as she\\'d see them scorching the things.\\\\r\",\"She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour\\\\r\",\"and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because\\\\r\",\"the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father\\\\r\",\"brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she\\\\r\",\"thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that\\\\r\",\"morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that\\\\r\",\"was for luck and lovers\\' meeting if you put those things on inside out\\\\r\",\"or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it\\\\r\",\"wasn\\'t of a Friday.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"And yet and yet!

It was the men\\'s temperance retreat conducted by\\\\r\",\"the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and\\\\r\",\"benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered\\\\r\",\"together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying\\\\r\",\"spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the\\\\r\",\"storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate,\\\\r\",\"reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede\\\\r\",\"for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.

Had her father only avoided the clutches of\\\\r\",\"the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit\\\\r\",\"cured in Pearson\\'s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage,\\\\r\",\"second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by\\\\r\",\"the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two\\\\r\",\"lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at\\\\r\",\"the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction\\\\r\",\"which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her\\\\r\",\"childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of\\\\r\",\"violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to\\\\r\",\"the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was\\\\r\",\"one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts\\\\r\",\"his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded\\\\r\",\"as the lowest of the low.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,\\\\r\",\"Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard\\\\r\",\"her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off\\\\r\",\"Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like\\\\r\",\"himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him\\\\r\",\"any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a\\\\r\",\"father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it\\\\r\",\"was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the\\\\r\",\"pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor\\\\r\",\"father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang Tell me,\\\\r\",\"Mary, how to woo thee or My love and cottage near Rochelle and they had\\\\r\",\"stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby\\'s salad dressing for supper and\\\\r\",\"when he sang The moon hath raised with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and\\\\r\",\"was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother\\'s birthday\\\\r\",\"that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and\\\\r\",\"Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.\\\\r\",\"No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest.\\\\r\",\"And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest\\\\r\",\"of his days and he couldn\\'t even go to the funeral on account of the\\\\r\",\"gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples\\\\r\",\"from his office about Catesby\\'s cork lino, artistic, standard designs,\\\\r\",\"fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the\\\\r\",\"home.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the\\\\r\",\"house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in\\\\r\",\"gold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was\\\\r\",\"it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn\\'t\\\\r\",\"like her mother\\'s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single\\\\r\",\"thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the\\\\r\",\"world of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at\\\\r\",\"the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that\\\\r\",\"place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr\\\\r\",\"Tunney the grocer\\'s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where\\\\r\",\"a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a\\\\r\",\"threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with\\\\r\",\"oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a\\\\r\",\"story behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a\\\\r\",\"soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in\\\\r\",\"chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them\\\\r\",\"dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms\\\\r\",\"that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and\\\\r\",\"thought about those times because she had found out in Walker\\'s\\\\r\",\"pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the\\\\r\",\"halcyon days what they meant.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till\\\\r\",\"at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no\\\\r\",\"getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he\\\\r\",\"could down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was\\\\r\",\"not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was\\\\r\",\"sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted\\\\r\",\"the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and\\\\r\",\"to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to\\\\r\",\"her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it\\\\r\",\"up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and\\\\r\",\"stopped right under Gerty\\'s skirt near the little pool by the rock. The\\\\r\",\"twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let\\\\r\",\"them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their\\\\r\",\"stupid ball hadn\\'t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she\\\\r\",\"missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her\\\\r\",\"pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted\\\\r\",\"her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a\\\\r\",\"jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down\\\\r\",\"towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw\\\\r\",\"attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the\\\\r\",\"warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and\\\\r\",\"flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of\\\\r\",\"the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a\\\\r\",\"look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan\\\\r\",\"and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted\\\\r\",\"and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of\\\\r\",\"original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for\\\\r\",\"us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And\\\\r\",\"careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many\\\\r\",\"who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all\\\\r\",\"that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told\\\\r\",\"them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the\\\\r\",\"most pious Virgin\\'s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any\\\\r\",\"age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned\\\\r\",\"by her.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of\\\\r\",\"childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with\\\\r\",\"baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep\\\\r\",\"she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy\\\\r\",\"gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,\\\\r\",\"didn\\'t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Say papa, baby.

Of course his infant majesty was most\\\\r\",\"obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.

She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the\\\\r\",\"paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured\\\\r\",\"chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the\\\\r\",\"evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to\\\\r\",\"hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in\\\\r\",\"the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went\\\\r\",\"pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his\\\\r\",\"look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through\\\\r\",\"and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly\\\\r\",\"expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer. She could\\\\r\",\"see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was\\\\r\",\"a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the\\\\r\",\"matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she\\\\r\",\"wasn\\'t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always\\\\r\",\"dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had\\\\r\",\"an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussÃ© from where he was sitting. He\\\\r\",\"was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting\\\\r\",\"sorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what\\\\r\",\"it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the\\\\r\",\"ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if\\\\r\",\"she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad\\\\r\",\"that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking\\\\r\",\"Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which\\\\r\",\"she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on\\\\r\",\"her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he\\\\r\",\"was like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him,\\\\r\",\"her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had\\\\r\",\"suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had\\\\r\",\"been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a\\\\r\",\"protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved\\\\r\",\"her. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a\\\\r\",\"womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known,\\\\r\",\"those cyclists showing off what they hadn\\'t got and she just yearned to\\\\r\",\"know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her,\\\\r\",\"make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her\\\\r\",\"gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her,\\\\r\",\"his ownest girlie, for herself alone.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Refuge of sinners.

Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained\\\\r\",\"glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners\\\\r\",\"of the blessed Virgin\\'s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon\\\\r\",\"O\\'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast\\\\r\",\"down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and\\\\r\",\"clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she\\\\r\",\"became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the\\\\r\",\"convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she\\\\r\",\"told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her\\\\r\",\"hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the\\\\r\",\"voice of nature and we were all subject to nature\\'s laws, he said, in\\\\r\",\"this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of\\\\r\",\"woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said\\\\r\",\"to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He\\\\r\",\"was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could\\\\r\",\"she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a\\\\r\",\"present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece\\\\r\",\"white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell\\\\r\",\"the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours\\'\\\\r\",\"adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or\\\\r\",\"perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky\\\\r\",\"threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little\\\\r\",\"monkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a\\\\r\",\"good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of\\\\r\",\"them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they\\\\r\",\"were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Jacky! Tommy!\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very\\\\r\",\"last time she\\'d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and\\\\r\",\"she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a\\\\r\",\"good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the\\\\r\",\"thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn\\'t get it to grow\\\\r\",\"long because it wasn\\'t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at\\\\r\",\"it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn\\'t rip up\\\\r\",\"her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot\\\\r\",\"of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever\\\\r\",\"she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was\\\\r\",\"a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her\\\\r\",\"petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would\\\\r\",\"have served her just right if she had tripped up over something\\\\r\",\"accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to\\\\r\",\"make her look tall and got a fine tumble. Tableau! That would have been\\\\r\",\"a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,\\\\r\",\"they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed\\\\r\",\"the thurible to Canon O\\'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the\\\\r\",\"Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was\\\\r\",\"itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn\\'t\\\\r\",\"because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger\\\\r\",\"mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he\\\\r\",\"never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O\\'Hanlon handed the\\\\r\",\"thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed\\\\r\",\"Sacrament and the choir began to sing the Tantum ergo and she just swung\\\\r\",\"her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the Tantumer\\\\r\",\"gosa cramen tum. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in\\\\r\",\"Sparrow\\'s of George\\'s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter\\\\r\",\"and there wasn\\'t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at,\\\\r\",\"transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape\\\\r\",\"nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the\\\\r\",\"difference for himself.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with\\\\r\",\"her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a\\\\r\",\"streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only\\\\r\",\"a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat\\\\r\",\"hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to\\\\r\",\"settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was\\\\r\",\"never seen on a girl\\'s shoulders—a radiant little vision, in sooth,\\\\r\",\"almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long\\\\r\",\"mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost\\\\r\",\"see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her\\\\r\",\"tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from\\\\r\",\"underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath\\\\r\",\"caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a\\\\r\",\"snake eyes its prey. Her woman\\'s instinct told her that she had raised\\\\r\",\"the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat\\\\r\",\"to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,\\\\r\",\"half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the\\\\r\",\"baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why\\\\r\",\"no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of\\\\r\",\"hers. And she said to Gerty:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—A penny for your thoughts.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I\\\\r\",\"was only wondering was it late.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Because she wished to goodness they\\'d take the snottynosed twins and\\\\r\",\"their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just\\\\r\",\"gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy\\\\r\",\"asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half\\\\r\",\"past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because\\\\r\",\"they were told to be in early.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Wait, said Cissy, I\\'ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what\\'s the\\\\r\",\"time by his conundrum.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his\\\\r\",\"hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his\\\\r\",\"watchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was\\\\r\",\"Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he\\\\r\",\"had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the\\\\r\",\"next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed\\\\r\",\"in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the\\\\r\",\"right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it\\\\r\",\"and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his\\\\r\",\"watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun\\\\r\",\"was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in\\\\r\",\"measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.\\\\r\",\"Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said\\\\r\",\"his waterworks were out of order.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Then they sang the second verse of the Tantum ergo and Canon O\\'Hanlon\\\\r\",\"got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told\\\\r\",\"Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the\\\\r\",\"flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could\\\\r\",\"see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she\\\\r\",\"swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he\\\\r\",\"could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch\\\\r\",\"or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands\\\\r\",\"back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over\\\\r\",\"her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against\\\\r\",\"her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too\\\\r\",\"was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes\\\\r\",\"fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally\\\\r\",\"worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a\\\\r\",\"man\\'s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man\\'s face.\\\\r\",\"It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty\\\\r\",\"noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect\\\\r\",\"because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place\\\\r\",\"to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins\\' caps and tidied\\\\r\",\"their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O\\'Hanlon stood\\\\r\",\"up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the\\\\r\",\"card to read off and he read out Panem de coelo praestitisti eis and Edy\\\\r\",\"and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but\\\\r\",\"Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with\\\\r\",\"scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her\\\\r\",\"best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze\\\\r\",\"shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt—O\\\\r\",\"yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like\\\\r\",\"that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.\\\\r\",\"Gerty\\'s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the\\\\r\",\"sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully\\\\r\",\"moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him\\\\r\",\"better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex\\\\r\",\"he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant\\\\r\",\"there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were\\\\r\",\"probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in\\\\r\",\"sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head\\\\r\",\"flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it\\'s leap year.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the\\\\r\",\"ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young\\\\r\",\"voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As\\\\r\",\"for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck\\\\r\",\"him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as\\\\r\",\"much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen\\\\r\",\"pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one\\\\r\",\"look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss\\\\r\",\"puny little Edy\\'s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could\\\\r\",\"see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering\\\\r\",\"rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had\\\\r\",\"struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was\\\\r\",\"something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and\\\\r\",\"never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it\\\\r\",\"so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in\\\\r\",\"the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the\\\\r\",\"sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him\\\\r\",\"too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby\\\\r\",\"looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy\\\\r\",\"poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as\\\\r\",\"much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to\\\\r\",\"his brandnew dribbling bib.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—O my!

And\\\\r\",\"they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said,\\\\r\",\"the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of\\\\r\",\"this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had\\\\r\",\"conscience to let her die.

Another then put in his word: And they\\\\r\",\"dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and\\\\r\",\"girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him\\\\r\",\"all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of\\\\r\",\"the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market\\\\r\",\"so that he could doss and dung to his heart\\'s content. By this time the\\\\r\",\"father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that\\\\r\",\"he could scarce walk to pasture.

Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he\\\\r\",\"would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself\\\\r\",\"(for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up\\\\r\",\"on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying:\\\\r\",\"By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And,\\\\r\",\"says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or\\\\r\",\"the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much\\\\r\",\"as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he\\'d run amok over half\\\\r\",\"the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all\\\\r\",\"by lord Harry\\'s orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says\\\\r\",\"Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks\\\\r\",\"in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house\\\\r\",\"and I\\'ll meddle in his matters, says he. I\\'ll make that animal smell\\\\r\",\"hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But\\\\r\",\"one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal\\\\r\",\"pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for\\\\r\",\"himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row\\\\r\",\"with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull\\\\r\",\"and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he\\\\r\",\"found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous\\\\r\",\"champion bull of the Romans, Bos Bovum, which is good bog Latin for boss\\\\r\",\"of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head\\\\r\",\"into a cow\\'s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and\\\\r\",\"pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the water\\\\r\",\"running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to\\\\r\",\"his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls\\' language to study but\\\\r\",\"he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun\\\\r\",\"which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for\\\\r\",\"a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his\\\\r\",\"fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a\\\\r\",\"corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast\\\\r\",\"friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end\\\\r\",\"was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate\\\\r\",\"women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and\\\\r\",\"their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the\\\\r\",\"yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind,\\\\r\",\"put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm,\\\\r\",\"ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run,\\\\r\",\"pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of\\\\r\",\"America.

Well,\\\\r\",\"let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it\\\\r\",\"smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both.', metadata={'source': '/content/output.json', 'seq_num': 1543}), Document(page_content='\\'Tis as cheap sitting as\\\\r\",\"standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon\\\\r\",\"his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a\\\\r\",\"consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the\\\\r\",\"prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal\\\\r\",\"vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the\\\\r\",\"prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities\\\\r\",\"acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch\\\\r\",\"defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable\\\\r\",\"females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their\\\\r\",\"flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly\\\\r\",\"bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might\\\\r\",\"multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of\\\\r\",\"their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he\\\\r\",\"assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he\\\\r\",\"concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with\\\\r\",\"certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had\\\\r\",\"resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay\\\\r\",\"island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of\\\\r\",\"note much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up\\\\r\",\"there a national fertilising farm to be named Omphalos with an obelisk\\\\r\",\"hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful\\\\r\",\"yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life\\\\r\",\"soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the\\\\r\",\"functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he\\\\r\",\"take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the\\\\r\",\"opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers\\\\r\",\"were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.\\\\r\",\"For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a\\\\r\",\"diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these\\\\r\",\"latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both\\\\r\",\"broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum\\\\r\",\"chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of\\\\r\",\"asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with\\\\r\",\"which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the\\\\r\",\"rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be\\\\r\",\"observed by Mr Mulligan\\'s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now\\\\r\",\"somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained\\\\r\",\"by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of\\\\r\",\"Mary\\'s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also\\\\r\",\"to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the\\\\r\",\"scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon\\\\r\",\"his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his\\\\r\",\"contention: Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut\\\\r\",\"matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici\\\\r\",\"titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus\\\\r\",\"centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt, while for those of ruder wit\\\\r\",\"he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable\\\\r\",\"to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard\\\\r\",\"drake and duck.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper\\\\r\",\"man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with\\\\r\",\"animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics\\\\r\",\"while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had\\\\r\",\"advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a\\\\r\",\"passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his\\\\r\",\"nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom\\\\r\",\"were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a\\\\r\",\"civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional\\\\r\",\"assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very\\\\r\",\"heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was\\\\r\",\"come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne\\'s house, that was in an\\\\r\",\"interesting condition, poor body, from woman\\'s woe (and here he fetched\\\\r\",\"a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon, to\\\\r\",\"turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his\\\\r\",\"incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an\\\\r\",\"ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,\\\\r\",\"as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.\\\\r\",\"For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote\\\\r\",\"himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll\\\\r\",\"mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though\\\\r\",\"\\'tis pity she\\'s a trollop): There\\'s a belly that never bore a bastard.\\\\r\",\"This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw\\\\r\",\"the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.

With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a\\\\r\",\"complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his\\\\r\",\"bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very\\\\r\",\"picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.\\\\r\",\"Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he\\\\r\",\"said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting\\\\r\",\"instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her\\\\r\",\"feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so\\\\r\",\"melting a tenderness, \\'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been\\\\r\",\"impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of\\\\r\",\"such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.

During the past four minutes or thereabouts\\\\r\",\"he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled\\\\r\",\"by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated\\\\r\",\"amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was\\\\r\",\"certainly calculated to attract anyone\\'s remark on account of its\\\\r\",\"scarlet appearance.

Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The\\\\r\",\"debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on\\\\r\",\"the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne\\'s house had never\\\\r\",\"beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old\\\\r\",\"rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so\\\\r\",\"encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at\\\\r\",\"the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing\\\\r\",\"from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him,\\\\r\",\"was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity\\\\r\",\"and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to\\\\r\",\"Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose\\\\r\",\"the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant\\\\r\",\"before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in\\\\r\",\"explorer\\'s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted\\\\r\",\"sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi\\\\r\",\"Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young\\\\r\",\"poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical\\\\r\",\"inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to\\\\r\",\"right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator,\\\\r\",\"fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the\\\\r\",\"dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible\\\\r\",\"dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril\\\\r\",\"or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous\\\\r\",\"loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages\\\\r\",\"yet to come.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted\\\\r\",\"transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus\\' (Div.', metadata={'source': '/content/output.json', 'seq_num': 1569}), Document(page_content='Scep.) contentions would\\\\r\",\"appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to\\\\r\",\"accepted scientific methods.

The man of science like the man in the\\\\r\",\"street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain\\\\r\",\"them as best he can.

Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.\\\\r\",\"Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary\\\\r\",\"(the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth\\\\r\",\"of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the\\\\r\",\"differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to\\\\r\",\"opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig,\\\\r\",\"Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a\\\\r\",\"cooperation (one of nature\\'s favourite devices) between the nisus\\\\r\",\"formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily\\\\r\",\"chosen position, succubitus felix of the passive element. The other\\\\r\",\"problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant\\\\r\",\"mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are\\\\r\",\"all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M.\\\\r\",\"Mulligan (Hyg.', metadata={'source': '/content/output.json', 'seq_num': 1571}), Document(page_content='et Eug.

Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and\\\\r\",\"all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature,\\\\r\",\"light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the\\\\r\",\"classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured\\\\r\",\"photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable\\\\r\",\"ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months\\\\r\",\"in a most enjoyable manner.

His\\\\r\",\"(Stephen\\'s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit\\\\r\",\"unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom\\\\r\",\"in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water\\\\r\",\"available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an\\\\r\",\"expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman\\'s\\\\r\",\"shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge\\\\r\",\"where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and\\\\r\",\"soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he\\\\r\",\"was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him\\\\r\",\"to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means\\\\r\",\"during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was\\\\r\",\"rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable\\\\r\",\"to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then\\\\r\",\"condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always\\\\r\",\"assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a\\\\r\",\"few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to\\\\r\",\"take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman\\\\r\",\"service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver\\\\r\",\"street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier\\'s and the\\\\r\",\"distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of\\\\r\",\"Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence\\\\r\",\"debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin\\'s. But\\\\r\",\"as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for\\\\r\",\"hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some\\\\r\",\"fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was\\\\r\",\"no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was\\\\r\",\"anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting\\\\r\",\"a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently\\\\r\",\"there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it\\\\r\",\"which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett\\'s and the\\\\r\",\"Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the\\\\r\",\"direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped\\\\r\",\"by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to\\\\r\",\"vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,\\\\r\",\"entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made\\\\r\",\"light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed\\\\r\",\"for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it\\\\r\",\"cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered\\\\r\",\"along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a\\\\r\",\"jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company\\'s sandstrewer\\\\r\",\"happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion Ã\\\\r\",\"propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little\\\\r\",\"while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway\\\\r\",\"station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was\\\\r\",\"suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a\\\\r\",\"not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more\\\\r\",\"especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course\\\\r\",\"turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.\\\\r\",\"Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford\\\\r\",\"place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird\\'s the\\\\r\",\"stonecutter\\'s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the\\\\r\",\"right, while the other who was acting as his fidus Achates inhaled with\\\\r\",\"internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke\\'s city bakery, situated\\\\r\",\"quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our\\\\r\",\"daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most\\\\r\",\"indispensable.

Stephen of his own accord stopped for no\\\\r\",\"special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the\\\\r\",\"light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker\\\\r\",\"figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He\\\\r\",\"began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having\\\\r\",\"happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered\\\\r\",\"that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father\\'s,\\\\r\",\"Gumley.

Lord John Corley some called him\\\\r\",\"and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of\\\\r\",\"inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a\\\\r\",\"certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His\\\\r\",\"grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of\\\\r\",\"a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.\\\\r\",\"Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of\\\\r\",\"the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably\\\\r\",\"fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or\\\\r\",\"some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed\\\\r\",\"the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This therefore\\\\r\",\"was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man\\\\r\",\"who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious\\\\r\",\"proclivities as Lord John Corley.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.\\\\r\",\"Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night\\'s lodgings. His friends\\\\r\",\"had all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called\\\\r\",\"him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other\\\\r\",\"uncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to\\\\r\",\"tell him where on God\\'s earth he could get something, anything at all,\\\\r\",\"to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was\\\\r\",\"fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected\\\\r\",\"through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same\\\\r\",\"time if the whole thing wasn\\'t a complete fabrication from start to\\\\r\",\"finish.

Ate. A Greek he was.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged\\\\r\",\"end:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—As bad as old Antonio, For he left me on my ownio.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat\\\\r\",\"peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her\\\\r\",\"own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom,\\\\r\",\"scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment\\\\r\",\"flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink\\\\r\",\"sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had\\\\r\",\"laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though\\\\r\",\"why pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round\\\\r\",\"the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that\\\\r\",\"afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the\\\\r\",\"lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)\\\\r\",\"and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed\\\\r\",\"rather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to\\\\r\",\"admit he had washed his wife\\'s undergarments when soiled in Holles\\\\r\",\"street and women would and did too a man\\'s similar garments initialled\\\\r\",\"with Bewley and Draper\\'s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really\\\\r\",\"loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still just\\\\r\",\"then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female\\'s room more than her\\\\r\",\"company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude\\\\r\",\"sign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he\\\\r\",\"just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door\\\\r\",\"with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all\\\\r\",\"there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper\\\\r\",\"Murphy\\'s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—The gunboat, the keeper said.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how\\\\r\",\"a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with\\\\r\",\"disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober\\\\r\",\"senses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of\\\\r\",\"course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.\\\\r\",\"Still no matter what the cause is from...\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely\\\\r\",\"remarking:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a\\\\r\",\"roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to\\\\r\",\"buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,\\\\r\",\"said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a\\\\r\",\"stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any\\\\r\",\"oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, w ere not\\\\r\",\"licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he\\\\r\",\"could truthfully state, he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate\\\\r\",\"of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort,\\\\r\",\"he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting\\\\r\",\"boon on everybody concerned.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe\\\\r\",\"in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as\\\\r\",\"distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I\\\\r\",\"believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as\\\\r\",\"the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such\\\\r\",\"inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try\\\\r\",\"and concentrate and remember before he could say:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and\\\\r\",\"therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the\\\\r\",\"possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can\\\\r\",\"hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other\\\\r\",\"practical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being\\\\r\",\"excluded by court etiquette.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the\\\\r\",\"mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he\\\\r\",\"felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly\\\\r\",\"rejoining:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Simple? I shouldn\\'t think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant\\\\r\",\"you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a\\\\r\",\"blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for\\\\r\",\"instance to invent those rays RÃ¶ntgen did or the telescope like Edison,\\\\r\",\"though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and\\\\r\",\"the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural\\\\r\",\"phenomenon such as electricity but it\\'s a horse of quite another colour\\\\r\",\"to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several\\\\r\",\"of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial\\\\r\",\"evidence.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they\\\\r\",\"were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in\\\\r\",\"their respective ages, clashed.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his\\\\r\",\"original point with a smile of unbelief.

I can\\'t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article,\\\\r\",\"a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or\\\\r\",\"antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least\\\\r\",\"conspicuous point about it.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Our mutual friend\\'s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom apropos of\\\\r\",\"knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce. Do you think they are\\\\r\",\"genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and\\\\r\",\"lie like old boots. Look at him.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was\\\\r\",\"full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it\\\\r\",\"was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire\\\\r\",\"fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent\\\\r\",\"probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly\\\\r\",\"accurate gospel.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and\\\\r\",\"Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.

On the\\\\r\",\"other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because\\\\r\",\"meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting\\\\r\",\"news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean\\\\r\",\"seas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera.

At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some\\\\r\",\"score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to\\\\r\",\"parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in\\\\r\",\"retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a\\\\r\",\"sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the\\\\r\",\"evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in\\\\r\",\"people\\'s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper\\\\r\",\"or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn\\'t\\\\r\",\"exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in\\\\r\",\"thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern\\\\r\",\"opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was\\\\r\",\"subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step\\\\r\",\"farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time\\\\r\",\"inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly\\\\r\",\"resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our\\\\r\",\"friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan\\'s so that he,\\\\r\",\"though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of\\\\r\",\"mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him\\\\r\",\"(metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics\\\\r\",\"themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties\\\\r\",\"invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity\\\\r\",\"and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on\\\\r\",\"fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it\\\\r\",\"was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was\\\\r\",\"a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue\\\\r\",\"(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash\\\\r\",\"altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed\\\\r\",\"unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or\\\\r\",\"the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he\\\\r\",\"very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the other\\\\r\",\"hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or\\\\r\",\"Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of\\\\r\",\"the two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him\\\\r\",\"to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.\\\\r\",\"His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over\\\\r\",\"effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn\\'t what you\\\\r\",\"call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he\\\\r\",\"didn\\'t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did\\\\r\",\"entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal\\\\r\",\"pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some\\\\r\",\"wardrobe, if found suitable.

Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out,\\\\r\",\"paused at the, for a moment, the door.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the\\\\r\",\"moment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside\\\\r\",\"down, on the tables in cafÃ©s. To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom\\\\r\",\"replied without a moment\\'s hesitation, saying straight off:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—To sweep the floor in the morning.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same\\\\r\",\"time apologetic to get on his companion\\'s right, a habit of his, by the\\\\r\",\"bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The\\\\r\",\"night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit\\\\r\",\"weak on his pins.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a\\\\r\",\"moment. The only thing is to walk then you\\'ll feel a different man.\\\\r\",\"Come. It\\'s not far. Lean on me.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen\\'s right and led him on\\\\r\",\"accordingly.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind\\\\r\",\"of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all\\\\r\",\"that.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where the\\\\r\",\"municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and\\\\r\",\"purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of\\\\r\",\"fresh fields and pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones the\\\\r\",\"analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the\\\\r\",\"part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the\\\\r\",\"time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the\\\\r\",\"selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which\\\\r\",\"Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made\\\\r\",\"tracks arm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though\\\\r\",\"confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to\\\\r\",\"follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante\\'s Huguenots,\\\\r\",\"Meyerbeer\\'s Seven Last Words on the Cross and Mozart\\'s Twelfth Mass he\\\\r\",\"simply revelled in, the Gloria in that being, to his mind, the acme of\\\\r\",\"first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a\\\\r\",\"cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic\\\\r\",\"church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as\\\\r\",\"those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and i will live thy\\\\r\",\"protestant to be. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini\\'s\\\\r\",\"Stabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his\\\\r\",\"wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might\\\\r\",\"safely say, greatly adding to her other laureis and putting the others\\\\r\",\"totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers\\' church in upper Gardiner\\\\r\",\"street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with\\\\r\",\"virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that\\\\r\",\"there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of\\\\r\",\"worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced\\\\r\",\"desire for an encore. On the whole though favouring preferably light\\\\r\",\"opera of the Don Giovanni description and Martha, a gem in its line, he\\\\r\",\"had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe\\\\r\",\"classical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for\\\\r\",\"granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par\\\\r\",\"excellence Lionel\\'s air in Martha, M\\'appari, which, curiously enough, he\\\\r\",\"had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege\\\\r\",\"he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen\\'s respected father, sung\\\\r\",\"to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others\\\\r\",\"take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he\\\\r\",\"didn\\'t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare\\'s songs, at\\\\r\",\"least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in\\\\r\",\"Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi,\\\\r\",\"Doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold\\\\r\",\"Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly\\\\r\",\"sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their\\\\r\",\"dux and comes conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he\\\\r\",\"said, in the Queen\\'s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one\\\\r\",\"Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond\\\\r\",\"the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,\\\\r\",\"brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not\\\\r\",\"perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive\\\\r\",\"guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political\\\\r\",\"celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a\\\\r\",\"striking coincidence.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,\\\\r\",\"who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other\\'s sleeve\\\\r\",\"gently, jocosely remarking:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth\\\\r\",\"anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite\\\\r\",\"near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh\\\\r\",\"because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a\\\\r\",\"taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the\\\\r\",\"lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such\\\\r\",\"a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn\\'t a lump of sugar but, as he\\\\r\",\"wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency\\\\r\",\"that might crop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a\\\\r\",\"horse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected,\\\\r\",\"take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan\\'s, of the same size, would be a holy\\\\r\",\"horror to face. But it was no animal\\'s fault in particular if he was\\\\r\",\"built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes\\\\r\",\"into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or\\\\r\",\"trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale with a\\\\r\",\"harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the\\\\r\",\"joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely\\\\r\",\"reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat\\\\r\",\"distracted from Stephen\\'s words while the ship of the street was\\\\r\",\"manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"—What\\'s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging in\\\\r\",\"medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your\\\\r\",\"acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,\\\\r\",\"image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome\\\\r\",\"blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as\\\\r\",\"he was perhaps not that way built.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Still, supposing he had his father\\'s gift as he more than suspected, it\\\\r\",\"opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall\\'s Irish\\\\r\",\"industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here has End\\\\r\",\"by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come\\\\r\",\"from. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the\\\\r\",\"clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which\\\\r\",\"boggled Bloom a bit:\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"These opening bars he sang and translated extempore. Bloom, nodding,\\\\r\",\"said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which\\\\r\",\"he did.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,\\\\r\",\"which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily,\\\\r\",\"if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production\\\\r\",\"such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain,\\\\r\",\"command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for\\\\r\",\"its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrÃ©e into fashionable\\\\r\",\"houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large\\\\r\",\"way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.\\\\r\",\"A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more\\\\r\",\"influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct\\\\r\",\"success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the\\\\r\",\"purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to\\\\r\",\"so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a\\\\r\",\"youthful tyro in—society\\'s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a\\\\r\",\"little thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a\\\\r\",\"matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their\\\\r\",\"musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the\\\\r\",\"Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes\\\\r\",\"of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation,\\\\r\",\"cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record—in fact, without\\\\r\",\"giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could\\\\r\",\"easily have. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument\\\\r\",\"by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.\\\\r\",\"Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need\\\\r\",\"necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy\\\\r\",\"space of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or\\\\r\",\"nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his\\\\r\",\"dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be\\\\r\",\"handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.\\\\r\",\"Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original\\\\r\",\"music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have\\\\r\",\"a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin\\'s musical\\\\r\",\"world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a\\\\r\",\"confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus\\\\r\",\"omne. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his\\\\r\",\"hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a\\\\r\",\"high place in the city\\'s esteem where he could command a stiff figure\\\\r\",\"and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King\\\\r\",\"street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him\\\\r\",\"upstairs, so to speak, a big if, however, with some impetus of the\\\\r\",\"goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often\\\\r\",\"tripped-up a too much fÃªted prince of good fellows. And it need not\\\\r\",\"detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would\\\\r\",\"have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when\\\\r\",\"desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or\\\\r\",\"containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself\\\\r\",\"alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason\\\\r\",\"why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat\\\\r\",\"of any sort, hung on to him at all.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"The horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he\\\\r\",\"purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on\\\\r\",\"the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his\\\\r\",\"connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was\\\\r\",\"prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious\\\\r\",\"pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it\\\\r\",\"which in Bloom\\'s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of\\\\r\",\"a person\\'s character, no pun intended.\\\\r\",\"\\\\r\",\"The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and,\\\\r\",\"rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on\\\\r\",\"the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking\\\\r\",\"globes of turds.

her the one\\\\r\",\"they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on\\\\r\",\"it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of\\\\r\",\"them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears\\\\r\",\"supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like\\\\r\",\"elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off\\\\r\",\"him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child\\\\r\",\"but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I\\\\r\",\"suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about\\\\r\",\"me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll\\\\r\",\"do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene\\\\r\",\"he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons\\\\r\",\"housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account\\\\r\",\"of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup\\\\r\",\"row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a\\\\r\",\"carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about\\\\r\",\"everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew\\\\r\",\"he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me\\\\r\",\"so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup\\\\r\",\"things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study\\\\r\",\"up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could\\\\r\",\"always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him\\\\r\",\"after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he\\\\r\",\"used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going\\\\r\",\"to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byron\\'s poems\\\\r\",\"and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily\\\\r\",\"get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in\\\\r\",\"with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he\\\\r\",\"refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the\\\\r\",\"collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out I\\\\r\",\"kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let\\\\r\",\"him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes\\\\r\",\"mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and\\\\r\",\"ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool\\\\r\",\"me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his\\\\r\",\"plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own\\\\r\",\"job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could\\\\r\",\"hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking\\\\r\",\"me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres\\\\r\",\"something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was\\\\r\",\"in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let\\\\r\",\"out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let\\\\r\",\"him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me\\\\r\",\"Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and\\\\r\",\"when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did\\\\r\",\"you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on\\\\r\",\"thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on\\\\r\",\"the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what\\\\r\",\"spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at\\\\r\",\"that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was\\\\r\",\"too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged\\\\r\",\"afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of\\\\r\",\"laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling\\\\r\",\"out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great\\\\r\",\"humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it\\\\r\",\"meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us\\\\r\",\"not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault\\\\r\",\"she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes\\\\r\",\"got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her\\\\r\",\"face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she\\\\r\",\"must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she\\\\r\",\"was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him\\\\r\",\"to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to\\\\r\",\"go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine\\\\r\",\"having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any\\\\r\",\"moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy\\\\r\",\"anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes\\\\r\",\"in wet or shine and

p up O\\\\r\",\"sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to\\\\r\",\"extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could\\\\r\",\"you make of a man like that

knows\\\\r\",\"that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned\\\\r\",\"her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was\\\\r\",\"found out on her wasnt

        "#### Selecting Our VectorStore\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a number of different VectorStores, and a number of different strengths and weaknesses to each.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will be keeping it very simple by leveraging [Facebook AI Similarity Search](https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/#:~:text=FAISS%20(Facebook%20AI%20Similarity%20Search,more%20scalable%20similarity%20search%20functions.), or `FAISS`.\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to be setting up our VectorStore with the OpenAI embeddings model. While this embeddings model does not need to be consistent with the LLM selection, it does need to be consistent between embedding our index and embedding our queries over that index.\n",
        "\n",
        "While we don't have to worry too much about that in this example - it's something to keep in mind for more complex applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to leverage a [`CacheBackedEmbeddings`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/caching_embeddings )flow to prevent us from re-embedding similar queries over and over again.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* Purpose and Functionality:The vector store serves as a repository for structured documents that have been parsed into a format suitable for efficient querying and retrieval. It leverages FAISS, a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, to organize and index the documents based on their embeddings. The primary purpose of the vector store is to enable fast and effective similarity searches over the embedded documents, facilitating tasks such as information retrieval, recommendation systems, and similarity-based analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Underlying Technology - FAISS:FAISS is a widely-used library developed by Facebook AI Research for efficient similarity search and clustering in large-scale datasets.It provides various indexing methods optimized for both CPU and GPU architectures, enabling fast and scalable similarity search operations. FAISS is known for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional vector data, making it well-suited for applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Selection of Embeddings Model: The vector store is set up with embeddings generated by the OpenAI embeddings model, specifically the 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model.These embeddings are obtained by encoding the documents using the specified pre-trained language model, capturing semantic information and contextual representations of the text. It's crucial to ensure consistency between the embeddings model used for indexing (creating the vector store) and the one used for querying, as mismatched embeddings may lead to suboptimal search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "* CacheBackedEmbeddings for Optimization: To optimize the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of embedding queries, a CacheBackedEmbeddingsflow is employed. This flow caches previously computed embeddings, preventing redundant embeddings for similar queries and conserving both time and embedding tokens. By reducing redundant embeddings, this approach can significantly lower the computational overhead and overall cost associated with processing queries, especially for frequently occurring or similar queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Storage Considerations: The vector store may require significant storage resources, especially when dealing with large volumes of documents or high-dimensional embeddings. In this example, a LocalFileStore is used to manage the cached embeddings, storing them locally on the file system. It's essential to consider the trade-offs between storage cost and query performance when designing the vector store, as storing cached embeddings incurs additional storage overhead."

            "\n",
            "1. He mocks the idea of nationalism: Buck Mulligan is a Catholic from the Irish republican movement, but he mocks the idea of nationalism by pretending to be a British officer, using a fake English accent and pretending to be a member of the Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal organization. This satirical action highlights the absurdity of nationalist ideologies and the artificial nature of identity.\n",
            "2. He parodies the idea of masculinity: Buck Mulligan is a flamboyant and effeminate character who mocks traditional notions of masculinity. He wears a dressing gown and a hat, and engages in activities that are not typically associated with men, such as cooking and cleaning. This satirical action challenges the idea that there is only one acceptable way to be a man.\n",
            "3. He critiques the idea of religion: Buck Mulligan is a Catholic, but he mocks the idea of religion by pretending to be a pagan and using blasphemous language. This satirical action highlights the hypocrisy and absurdity of religious dogma.\n",
            "4. He satirizes the idea of education: Buck Mulligan is a medical student, but he mocks the idea of education by pretending to be an ignorant and uncultured person. This satirical action highlights the idea that knowledge and education are not always accessible or desirable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, Buck Mulligan's satirical actions in the first chapter of Ulysses challenge the conventions of identity, gender, religion, and education, and highlight the absurdity and hypocrisy of these social constructs.\n"

            "Similarities:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Epic scope: Both Ulysses and the Odyssey are considered epic works, with grand themes and sweeping narratives that encompass the human experience.\n",
            "2. Journey motif: Both works feature a journey motif, with the protagonist (Ulysses/Odysseus) embarking on a transformative journey that changes them and their perspective on the world.\n",
            "3. Themes of identity and homecoming: Both works explore themes of identity and homecoming, with the protagonist seeking to reclaim their place in the world and find their true self.\n",
            "4. Use of mythology: Both works draw on mythology to explore universal themes and archetypes, with Ulysses incorporating elements of the Odyssey and other Greek myths into its narrative.\n",
            "\n",
            "Differences:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Style and structure: Ulysses is written in a highly experimental and modernist style, with multiple narrative threads and a stream-of-consciousness narrative that challenges traditional notions of storytelling. The Odyssey, on the other hand, is written in a more traditional epic style, with a linear narrative and a clear beginning, middle, and end.\n",
            "2. Tone and mood: Ulysses is often described as dark and introspective, with a focus on the inner lives of its characters and the search for meaning in a chaotic world. The Odyssey, by contrast, is more lighthearted and adventurous, with a focus on the external journey and the triumph of the hero over adversity.\n",
            "3. Setting and characters: Ulysses is set in Dublin and features a cast of characters drawn from the city's streets and pubs, while the Odyssey is set in ancient Greece and features a cast of mythical characters, including gods and monsters.\n",
            "4. Themes of national identity: Ulysses explores themes of Irish identity and the search for a sense of belonging in a rapidly changing world, while the Odyssey explores themes of Greek identity and the search for a sense of homecoming after a long journey.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, while Ulysses and the Odyssey share many similarities in terms of themes and motifs, they are also distinct works with their own unique styles, tones, and perspectives on the human experience.\n"

Consequently, the decision was made to employ this model in conjunction with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key parameter, 'return_full_text', was configured to 'false', indicating that the generated text need not adhere strictly to the chunk lengths present in the original dataset. This adjustment was pivotal as it allowed the model to dynamically assess the appropriate length of response given the query, thereby enhancing flexibility in response generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Temperature, a critical parameter governing the degree of randomness in text generation, was meticulously tuned to 0.3 through iterative experimentation. This value was deemed optimal by the group, striking a delicate balance between minimizing hallucinations while preserving creative output in the generated text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, 'max_new_tokens' was set to 1000, providing a flexible threshold for the length of newly generated text, adaptable to the specific requirements of the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the realm of sentence embeddings, the group leveraged the 'sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2' model. While alternative embeddings were considered and exhibited competitive performance, this particular embedding, coupled with its associated vector store, demonstrated a distinct advantage in handling thematic and abstract inquiries during the evaluation process. Notably, the selection process underscored the nuanced interplay between embedding methodologies and the nature of the queries posed, highlighting the importance of aligning embedding choices with task-specific requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the group meticulously evaluated various similarity search algorithms, ultimately opting for the standard 'vector_store.similarity_search_by_vector' method facilitated by FAISS. While alternatives such as cosine similarity, L2 Manhattan similarity, and Euclidean distance were scrutinized, they yielded comparable results, with slight variations observed primarily in the case of L2 Manhattan similarity. The decision to adhere to the standard similarity search method underscores the reliability and consistency demonstrated by FAISS in facilitating effective similarity retrieval.\n",

        "These steps, meticulously outlined in the prompt engineering process, represent a concerted effort to optimize the output generated by the LLama model in conjunction with RAG. By fine-tuning parameters, selecting appropriate embeddings, and evaluating similarity search methodologies, the group endeavors to enhance the quality and coherence of generated text, thereby advancing the efficacy of AI-driven natural language processing tasks."
